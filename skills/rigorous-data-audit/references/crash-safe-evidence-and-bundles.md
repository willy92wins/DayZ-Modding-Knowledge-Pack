# Crash-safe evidence indexes and multi-root bundle publication

Use this reference when an audit covers a long-running evidence campaign,
generated final index, or a release that publishes into more than one physical
root. These are audit invariants; they do not by themselves prove a particular
runtime has passed them.

## Authoritative evidence index

[EXACT][CLAIM-R21-RDA-CRASH-EVIDENCE] A crash-sensitive runtime MUST NOT append
directly to its authoritative final index.

Audit for this sequence:

1. Give each logical event a stable logical identity and each physical write a
   distinct attempt ID.
2. Materialize a create-only temporary event file, durably write it, re-read
   and verify it, then atomically rename it to an absent final path.
3. Aggregate event files order-independently and fail closed when duplicate
   logical identities disagree.
4. Publish the final JSONL/index create-only once, after a quiescent close. It
   must represent `FAIL` and `INCOMPLETE`, not only successful completion.
5. Fault both sides of every write, flush, re-read and rename boundary.

An append-only final file without a verifiable event set can be truncated,
duplicated or left internally plausible after termination.

## Publication across physical roots

[EXACT][CLAIM-R21-RDA-MULTIROOT-PUBLISH] A bundle spanning client, server,
profiles, persistence or config roots is not one atomic filesystem update.

Require:

- exact PRE and POST manifests;
- same-volume staging and archive capacity for every root;
- an append-only `PENDING` / `COMMIT` / `ABORT` journal;
- launch refusal while a transaction is `PENDING`;
- `COMMIT` only after every POST hash matches;
- `ABORT` only after every PRE hash, or first-install absence, is restored;
- termination injection at each materialize, archive, publish, verify and
  receipt boundary, in both forward and rollback directions.

If the product contract fixes canonical launch paths, generation directories
are staging/archive only; they must not silently replace the active arguments.

## Crash-recovery audit refinements

[EXACT][CLAIM-R21-RDA-PROMOTION-RECOVERY-REFINEMENTS] For a recoverable
multi-root publisher, also audit these less-obvious boundaries:

1. Publish the transaction root only after its sealed plan and first durable
   `PENDING` event exist. A visible directory without authoritative evidence is
   not a recoverable transaction.
2. Define digest identity per artifact kind. A standalone file digest must
   represent its bytes, not a source basename that can legitimately change at
   the destination.
3. Separate historical terminal validation from live-target adjudication.
   Verify every old chain and receipt, but do not require current targets to
   remain forever at an older committed generation.
4. Give each retry a distinct attempt/transaction ID. Reusing the same ID after
   a clean `ABORT` turns valid terminal evidence into a permanent retry poison.
5. Revalidate sealed contracts and logical/physical bindings after acquiring
   all locks. Repeat target CAS before backup, before moving the target, and
   immediately before `COMMIT`.
6. Treat unknown target content as foreign evidence. Never delete, archive or
   restore over a digest that is neither the sealed PRE nor POST.
7. Do not write a diagnostic report inside a transaction root until its path,
   sealed plan and event chain are trusted.
8. Reject or explicitly preserve nested symlink/junction semantics in payload,
   backup and recovery sidecars; materializing a link target is not equivalent
   to restoring the link.
9. Keep lock metadata outside the protected content boundary. If an allowed
   physical root can equal the promoted target, `root/.lock` changes the digest
   it is meant to protect and an exclusive lock may make its own readback fail.
10. Use one path-ordering rule for the sealed source projection and the
    materialized tree readback. Host path semantics can order `SKILL.md` and
    `references/...` differently from raw string sorting, making a valid source
    impossible to verify after staging.
11. Treat platform rename denials as an adjudicated boundary. Retry only known
    transient codes, for a bounded interval, and only while source/destination
    still prove the prior attempt did not create an ambiguous state. Preserve a
    path-free OS error code for diagnosis; never turn a retry into a second
    blind mutation.
12. Preserve read-only payloads without making durability depend on a permanent
    metadata change. On Windows, `fsync` requires a write-capable descriptor:
    make only the unpublished copy temporarily writable, flush it, and restore
    its original mode even when the flush fails. Never mutate the source to
    make backup creation succeed.

These checks need fixtures for successive generations, retry after `ABORT`,
failure during transaction initialization, contract mutation while waiting for
locks, mutation after backup, renamed standalone-file snapshots, a lock root
equal to its target, mixed-case projected paths, transient/ambiguous renames
read-only copies and invalid transaction roots.
