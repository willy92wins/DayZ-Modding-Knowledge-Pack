# A1 — Character / Armature Animation in Blender via bpy (Deep Research)

Scope: authoring character/armature animation entirely through `bpy` code executed over the
MCP bridge (`execute_blender_code`), with no UI interaction available. Every API claim below
is cited to a doc URL; claims marked **[LIVE]** were additionally executed against a live,
connected Blender instance in this research session (not just read from docs).

## Doc versions checked

- **Connected Blender instance (this session): 5.1.1** — confirmed live via `bpy.app.version == (5, 1, 1)`.
- The Blender MCP server's bundled Python API RST reference (`get_python_api_docs` /
  `search_api_docs`) ships for this same 5.1 install — e.g. the `ActionSlot` doc links
  `docs.blender.org/manual/en/5.1/animation/actions.html#action-slots` explicitly.
- **`docs.blender.org` blocked the WebFetch tool site-wide (HTTP 403) for every URL tried
  this session**, including the bare `/api/current/` index. All docs.blender.org citations
  below therefore come from one of: (a) the bundled MCP RST docs (`get_python_api_docs`/
  `search_api_docs`/`search_manual_docs` — full RST text, not snippets), which is the primary
  source for "current/5.1" facts, or (b) WebSearch results, which in this environment returned
  real extracted page text (not just link snippets) even though direct WebFetch failed — used
  mainly for historical/4.3-era pages and cross-checks.
- Where marked **[4.3]**, a fact comes from a 4.3-era or archived `docs.blender.org/api/...`
  page, or the official 4.4 migration notes on `developer.blender.org` — not executed live
  (no 4.3 instance was available to connect to).
- Where marked **[LIVE]**, the fact was executed this session against the connected 5.1.1
  instance via `execute_blender_code`, exclusively on newly created data-blocks that were
  either never linked into the scene or explicitly unlinked and removed in a `finally` block.
  Every cleanup was itself verified with a follow-up `bpy.data` existence check. No user scene
  data was read, selected, or modified beyond a transient, restored active-object/selection
  state during two tests that required Edit/Pose mode.
- **Action Slots / layered animation (the single biggest 4.3→4.4+ breaking change relevant to
  this skill)** are covered in detail in the Actions & NLA section, cited to the official
  `developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.4/...` migration docs plus live confirmation that
  the legacy `Action.fcurves` accessor is gone entirely by 5.1.1.

## Workflow

Blocking → breakdowns → splining → polish maps onto concrete Blender mechanics, and Blender's
own keyframe-type vocabulary mirrors the traditional-animation terms almost 1:1 — this isn't
an analogy, it's a literal enum in the API.

**Blocking (pose-to-pose).** Key only the extreme/contact poses, spaced far apart, with
**stepped (constant) interpolation** so each pose holds fully until the next — this is how you
judge timing and silhouette before committing to in-betweens. Concretely:
- `keyframe_insert(..., keytype='EXTREME')` or `'KEYFRAME'` at sparse frames (contact poses).
- Force stepped playback by setting `Keyframe.interpolation = 'CONSTANT'` on every inserted
  key. Full enum (`bpy.types.Keyframe.interpolation`), **[LIVE]** read via
  `bpy.types.Keyframe.bl_rna.properties["interpolation"].enum_items`:
  `CONSTANT, LINEAR, BEZIER, SINE, QUAD, CUBIC, QUART, QUINT, EXPO, CIRC, BACK, BOUNCE, ELASTIC`.
- Blender's manual defines **Keyframe Types** for exactly this workflow
  (`manual/animation/keyframes/introduction.rst`, "Introduction > Keyframe Types"): *Keyframe*
  (normal), ***Breakdown*** ("Breakdown state, e.g. for transitions between key poses"),
  ***Moving Hold*** ("adds a small amount of motion around a holding pose"), ***Extreme***
  ("An 'extreme' state, or some other purpose as needed"), ***Jitter*** ("filler or baked
  keyframe for keying on ones"), ***Generated*** (tool-authored; safe to auto-remove/regenerate,
  e.g. by Copy Global Transform's "Fix to Camera"). This is the exact same enum as
  `keyframe_insert(..., keytype=...)` and `Keyframe.type` — **[LIVE]** confirmed identical:
  `['KEYFRAME', 'BREAKDOWN', 'MOVING_HOLD', 'EXTREME', 'JITTER', 'GENERATED']`.

**Breakdowns.** A breakdown pose is not the mathematical midpoint between two keys — it's
biased toward whichever extreme it "belongs" to (classic in-betweening). Blender ships
purpose-built pose operators that read the previous/next keyed pose and blend toward the
current frame by a factor, matching this workflow exactly (`bpy.ops.pose`, current):
- `breakdown(factor=0.5, prev_frame=0, next_frame=0, channels='ALL', axis_lock='FREE')` —
  "Create a suitable breakdown pose on the current frame."
- `push(...)` — exaggerate the current pose relative to the breakdown.
- `relax(...)` — pull the current pose toward its breakdown.
- `blend_to_neighbor(...)` / `blend_with_rest(...)` — same signature shape.

All five share an identical parameter shape: `factor` (0-1), `prev_frame`/`next_frame` (int,
the neighboring keyed frames), `channels` (`ALL|LOC|ROT|SIZE|BBONE|CUSTOM`), `axis_lock`
(`FREE|X|Y|Z`). Because these operators act on "current pose vs. keyed neighbors", they need a
real Pose-mode context (see Context overrides); a script can alternatively hand-author the same
blend by evaluating `Pose.apply_pose_from_action` / `Pose.blend_pose_from_action` directly and
skip the operator (and its context requirements) entirely. Tag the resulting keyframe with
`keytype='BREAKDOWN'` so later Dope Sheet/Graph Editor passes (and any downstream tooling) can
tell structural keys from breakdowns.

**Splining.** Switch from stepped to continuous curves and clean up arcs: iterate
`fcurve.keyframe_points`, set `kf.interpolation = 'BEZIER'`, and pick sane handle types
(`kf.handle_left_type` / `handle_right_type`, enum **[LIVE]** confirmed
`FREE, ALIGNED, VECTOR, AUTO, AUTO_CLAMPED`). `AUTO_CLAMPED` is the safe default that prevents
overshoot ("bump") artifacts on non-monotonic pose curves — the single most common cause of
ugly automatic tangents in scripted animation.

**Polish.** Per-curve handle nudges, `MOVING_HOLD` keys for held-pose micro-drift, and
staggered timing between body parts (arms/head trailing the hips) by offsetting individual
`Keyframe.co` per fcurve rather than moving whole poses — polish is inherently per-channel work,
which is exactly why it belongs at the F-Curve level rather than the whole-pose level.

## Posing & spaces (the matrix_basis story)

This is the part of the API that "trips everyone" — and it very nearly tripped this research
pass too (see the rotation-mode pitfall below), which is exactly why every claim here was
either read verbatim from the RNA doc text or executed live rather than recalled from memory.

### The four matrices

| Property | Space | Read/write | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Bone.matrix_local` | Armature (rest) | read-only | 4×4 **rest** matrix of the bone relative to the **armature**, not the parent. |
| `Bone.matrix` | Parent (rest) | read-only | 3×3 rest-orientation matrix relative to the parent. Rarely used directly by scripts. |
| `PoseBone.matrix_basis` | Local (relative to own rest + parent) | **read/write** | The literal composition of `location` + `rotation_quaternion`/`rotation_euler`/`rotation_axis_angle` + `scale` — i.e. exactly the channels keyframes drive. |
| `PoseBone.matrix` | **Armature object space** (not world!) | **read/write** | The final, on-screen pose after constraints and drivers — but still relative to the armature object's own origin, not the scene. |
| `PoseBone.matrix_channel` | Armature space, pre-constraint | read-only | Channels + drivers, but **before** constraints. Rarely needed. |

Exact doc text (`bpy.types.PoseBone`, current, matches connected 5.1.1):
- `matrix_basis`: *"Alternative access to location/scale/rotation relative to the parent and
  own rest bone."*
- `matrix`: *"Final 4×4 matrix after constraints and drivers are applied, in the armature
  object space."*
- `matrix_channel`: *"4×4 matrix of the bone's location/rotation/scale channels (including
  animation and drivers) and the effect of bone constraints"* — channel-only, pre-constraint,
  readonly.

**[LIVE]** verified the practical relationship: on a fresh 2-bone orphan armature, setting
`pose_bone.rotation_quaternion = Quaternion((0, 1, 0), radians(30))` then reading
`pose_bone.matrix_basis.to_quaternion()` gave `[0.966, 0, 0.259, 0]` — exactly
`cos(15°), 0, sin(15°), 0`, the half-angle quaternion for a 30° rotation about Y. Confirms
`matrix_basis` is a direct, literal composition of the channel properties; there is no hidden
extra transform baked in.

### matrix is armature-space, not world-space — the actual trap

`PoseBone.matrix` is documented as being in "the armature object space", which differs from
true world space whenever the armature object itself has a non-identity `matrix_world` (i.e.
almost always — parented, moved, or simply not at the scene origin). Reading/writing
`pose_bone.matrix` and expecting world-space coordinates is the single most common mistake.
The official conversion utility, called **on the armature object**, not the bone:

```
Object.convert_space(pose_bone=None, matrix=Matrix.Identity(4),
                      from_space='WORLD', to_space='WORLD') -> Matrix
```

`from_space`/`to_space` accept `'WORLD' | 'POSE' | 'LOCAL_WITH_PARENT' | 'LOCAL'` (the
constraint-space enum minus `'CUSTOM'`). `'POSE'` space is the same space as `PoseBone.matrix`
— per the manual's own Constraint "Space Types" definition (`manual/animation/constraints/
interface/common.rst`): *"Pose Space (Bones Only): Use the transformation relative to the
armature object."* **[LIVE]** verified callable: `arm_obj.convert_space(pose_bone=pb1,
matrix=pb1.matrix, from_space='POSE', to_space='WORLD')` returns a `mathutils.Matrix`.

Practical recipe:
```python
# Bone -> true world matrix
world_mat = arm_obj.convert_space(pose_bone=pb, matrix=pb.matrix,
                                   from_space='POSE', to_space='WORLD')
# True world target -> local channel assignable to matrix_basis
local_mat = arm_obj.convert_space(pose_bone=pb, matrix=world_target,
                                   from_space='WORLD', to_space='LOCAL')
pb.matrix_basis = local_mat
```

### Setting a pose: three different tasks, three different techniques

1. **Normal procedural/keyframed posing (the large majority of cases): just set the
   channels.** Assign `pose_bone.location` / `.rotation_quaternion` (or `.rotation_euler`) /
   `.scale` directly. Blender composes `matrix_basis` for you. Do not hand-build a
   `matrix_basis` unless you have a specific reason — it is more error-prone and buys nothing
   for ordinary posing.

2. **You have a target pose expressed as an armature-space matrix** (replaying a per-frame
   solve, matching another rig, etc.) — assign directly to `.matrix` (after converting to
   POSE/armature space if it started in world space), then force a dependency update:
   ```python
   pose_bone.matrix = target_matrix
   bpy.context.view_layer.update()
   ```
   This exact pattern is Blender's own documented idiom — the official
   `PoseBone.bbone_segment_matrix` example literally comments *"Instead of: `pbone.matrix =
   matrix` / `bpy.context.view_layer.update()`"* before presenting the batch alternative (next
   point). **Caveat:** assigning `.matrix` back-solves `matrix_basis` using the parent/
   constraint state **at that instant**. It is not a live link — change a parent bone or a
   constraint afterward without re-assigning, and the previously baked `matrix_basis` will not
   adjust itself.

3. **Setting a whole-body pose in one pass, without paying for a `view_layer.update()` per
   bone** (each is a full depsgraph re-evaluation): walk the hierarchy root→leaf and use the
   pure-math conversion `Bone.convert_local_to_pose(matrix, matrix_local, parent_matrix=...,
   parent_matrix_local=..., invert=True)`, documented as *"Unlike `Object.convert_space`, this
   uses custom rest and pose matrices provided by the caller"* — meaning it needs no depsgraph
   evaluation at all; you feed it the parent's *already-computed* pose matrix from earlier in
   your own recursive walk. This is Blender's own documented pattern for exactly this problem
   (see snippet 4 below, reproduced verbatim from the `Bone.convert_local_to_pose` docs).

### Bone spaces glossary (owner_space / target_space / convert_space)

Straight from the manual (`manual/animation/constraints/interface/common.rst`, "Common > Space
> Space Types" — the authoritative definition used everywhere Blender lets you pick a space,
not just constraints):
- **World Space** — relative to the world axes.
- **Custom Space** — relative to an arbitrary object/bone (constraints only; not on
  `convert_space`).
- **Pose Space** *(bones only)* — relative to the armature object.
- **Local Space** — for a bone: relative to its rest state, *after* that rest state was
  transformed by the bone's ancestors (what the Properties editor shows in Pose Mode if the
  bone has no other constraints).
- **Local With Parent** *(bones only)* — relative to the bone's rest state, but *including*
  the rotation/location difference caused by rotating ancestor bones (unlike plain Local
  Space).
- **Local Space (Owner Orientation)** *(bone targets only)* — Local Space of the target,
  re-oriented to match the owner's rest orientation, so a Copy-Rotation-style constraint
  reproduces the same *armature-space* motion regardless of each bone's individual rest
  orientation.

`Constraint.owner_space` / `Constraint.target_space` expose the full enum
(`WORLD, CUSTOM, POSE, LOCAL_WITH_PARENT, LOCAL`, plus `LOCAL_OWNER_ORIENT` on `target_space`
only). `Object.convert_space` exposes the four-value subset without `CUSTOM`/
`LOCAL_OWNER_ORIENT`.

### Rotation modes and gimbal lock

`PoseBone.rotation_mode` default is `'QUATERNION'` (doc text + **[LIVE]** RNA enum:
`['QUATERNION', 'XYZ', 'XZY', 'YXZ', 'YZX', 'ZXY', 'ZYX', 'AXIS_ANGLE']`). Recommendation for a
scripted rig:
- **Ball-and-socket joints** (shoulders, hips, spine) → keep **Quaternion**. No gimbal lock,
  but two caveats: (a) no single keyable "twist" axis for manual graph-editor polish; (b) the
  **double-cover problem** — `Q` and `-Q` represent the identical rotation but interpolate
  completely differently between keyframes, producing sudden flips. Blender ships
  `bpy.ops.pose.quaternions_flip()` ("Flip quaternion values to achieve desired rotations,
  while maintaining the same orientations") specifically to fix this after the fact;
  `mathutils.Quaternion.make_compatible(other)` is the scriptable, pre-emptive equivalent
  (call against the previous keyframe's quaternion before inserting a new one, to keep the
  shortest/consistent interpolation path).
- **Hinge-like joints** (elbows, knees, fingers) with one dominant axis → **Euler**, ordered
  so the least-animated axis is evaluated innermost — gives per-axis graph-editor curves
  (what you want for hand-polish), at the cost of gimbal lock if two axes align 90° apart
  mid-animation (a real risk on shoulders — avoid Euler there).

**[LIVE] Pitfall confirmed by direct test, not by memory:** calling
`bpy.ops.pose.rotation_mode_set(type='XYZ')` (the operator) correctly converts the **current
pose value** (quaternion → equivalent Euler, read back exactly as expected: 40° about Y in,
`[0, 40, 0]` Euler-degrees out) but does **not** retroactively touch existing F-Curves — the
old `rotation_quaternion` F-Curve is left in the action untouched, and no new
`rotation_euler` F-Curve is created until the next explicit `keyframe_insert`. Directly
assigning `pose_bone.rotation_mode = 'XYZ'` (data API, no operator) never touches F-Curves at
all, since a plain property assignment isn't an animation operation. **Practical rule: decide
each bone's rotation_mode before keying anything; never change rotation_mode mid-production on
an already-keyed bone without a manual re-key pass in the new mode.**

## Keyframing

**Primary API: `bpy_struct.keyframe_insert`** (inherited by every ID/nested struct, including
`PoseBone`, `Object`, `Action`, etc.):
```
keyframe_insert(data_path, *, index=-1, frame=bpy.context.scene.frame_current,
                group="", options=set(), keytype='KEYFRAME') -> bool
```
[`bpy.types.bpy_struct.keyframe_insert`, current] Every parameter verified against the doc
text:
- `data_path` — RNA path to the property, e.g. `"rotation_quaternion"` called **on the
  PoseBone itself**, or `'pose.bones["Bone1"].rotation_quaternion'` when constructing a path
  by hand for the owning object/Armature ID — see the nested-property gotcha below, the
  distinction matters and is explicit in the official docs.
- `index=-1` — default keys **all** array indices (e.g. all 4 quaternion or 3 location/Euler
  components) in one call; pass a specific index to key a single channel.
- `frame=bpy.context.scene.frame_current` — **this directly answers "insert at a specific
  frame without moving the playhead": pass `frame=N` explicitly.** `scene.frame_current` is
  only the *default* value used when `frame` is omitted; the call never touches the actual
  current-frame state itself.
- `group` — F-Curve/Action Group name (cosmetic grouping in Dope Sheet/Graph Editor).
- `options` — a set of flags: `INSERTKEY_NEEDED` (only insert where the value actually
  changes), `INSERTKEY_VISUAL` (key the *final*, constraint-evaluated transform instead of the
  raw channel — the data-level equivalent of "Visual Keying"), `INSERTKEY_REPLACE` (only
  overwrite existing keys, never add new ones), `INSERTKEY_AVAILABLE` (only insert into F-Curves
  that already exist), `INSERTKEY_CYCLE_AWARE` (respect cyclic extrapolation when inserting).
- `keytype` — one of `'KEYFRAME'|'BREAKDOWN'|'MOVING_HOLD'|'EXTREME'|'JITTER'|'GENERATED'`
  (see Workflow — this is literally the blocking/breakdown/polish vocabulary as a first-class
  enum). **[LIVE]** enum confirmed.

**Nested-property gotcha, straight from the official example**
(`bpy.types.bpy_struct.keyframe_insert` docs, example 2): *"Note that when keying data paths
which contain nested properties this must be done from the ID subclass, in this case the
Armature rather than the bone."* **[LIVE]** independently re-confirmed: after
`pose_bone.keyframe_insert(data_path="rotation_quaternion", frame=1)` (called directly on the
PoseBone, which resolves correctly because PoseBone can find its own owning `id_data`), the
resulting F-Curve's `data_path` reads `pose.bones["Bone1"].rotation_quaternion` and lives on
the **object's** action (`arm_obj.animation_data.action`) — bones are never independently
keyable IDs; every bone F-Curve is always rooted at the owning **Object**.

**Lower-level alternative: `FCurve.keyframe_points.insert(frame, value, *, options=set(),
keyframe_type='KEYFRAME')`** [`bpy.types.FCurveKeyframePoints.insert`, current] — inserts one
scalar point directly on an already-obtained F-Curve. Its `options` are a *different*, smaller
set than `keyframe_insert`'s: `REPLACE`, `NEEDED`, `FAST` (skip curve resort/recalc on every
insert — batch inserts should use `FAST` then call `fcurve.update()`/`.keyframe_points.sort()`
once at the end; the sibling methods `sort()`, `deduplicate()`, `handles_recalc()` exist
specifically to support this deferred-recalculation workflow). Use this when you already hold
the target F-Curve (e.g. via `action.fcurve_ensure_for_datablock(...)`, see Actions & NLA) and
want to avoid `keyframe_insert`'s per-call data-path string resolution across hundreds of keys.

**Keying Sets** (`bpy.types.KeyingSet`, `Scene.keying_sets` / `keying_sets_all`) bundle
multiple data-paths so one call keys "everything a rig needs." Blender ships a built-in
**Whole Character** keying set for exactly this — manual (`animation/keyframes/
keying_sets.rst`): *"made to keyframe all properties that are likely to get animated in a
character rig,"* and it explicitly skips bones whose name starts with prefixes reserved for
non-animatable technical/Rigify-generated bones. From a script, `bpy.ops.anim.keyframe_insert
(type='DEFAULT')` uses the *active* keying set (or user preferences if none is active);
`bpy.ops.anim.keying_set_active_set(type=...)` switches it first. For agent-authored scripts,
per-bone explicit `keyframe_insert()` calls are simpler to reason about and do not depend on
scene-level keying-set state — prefer them unless "key everything the rig defines" in one shot
is specifically what's needed.

**`bpy_extras.anim_utils.AutoKeying`** [`bpy_extras.anim_utils`, current] is the internal
helper that Blender's own auto-key system and the "Copy Global Transform" add-on use; it is
public/importable and exposes `options(...)` (context manager forcing a keytype/loc/rot/scale
selection), `key_transformation(context, target)`, and `keyframe_channels(...)`
(locked-channel-aware insertion). It is the "correct" way to *deliberately replicate* auto-key
behavior from a script — see the Auto-keying pitfall below for why that is preferable to
toggling the scene setting.

## Actions & NLA

**Version-critical background — check this before writing any Action-touching code.**
Blender 4.4 introduced **layered Actions** with **Action Slots**
(`developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.4/upgrading/slotted_actions/`,
`.../4.4/python_api/`, `.../docs/features/animation/animation_system/layered/`). An Action is
no longer a flat bag of F-Curves; the structure is
`Action.layers[ActionLayer].strips[ActionStrip → ActionKeyframeStrip].channelbags
[ActionChannelbag (keyed by slot)].fcurves`. A **slot** (`bpy.types.ActionSlot`) identifies
*which datablock* a subset of the Action's channels belongs to — this is what lets one Action
drive multiple objects/bone-sets in the new model. Every animated ID gets `AnimData.action_slot`
alongside `AnimData.action`.

- **4.3 and earlier [4.3]:** `Action.fcurves` is a **direct** collection (`ActionFCurves`):
  `action.fcurves.new(data_path, index=0, action_group="")` / `.find(data_path, index)`. No
  slots, no layers.
- **4.4 [4.3]:** layered model introduced; the old `action.fcurves`/`action.groups` accessors
  are kept as a **"backward-compatible legacy API,"** explicitly marked deprecated in the
  official migration notes.
- **5.0+ — confirmed [LIVE] on the connected 5.1.1 instance:** the legacy `Action.fcurves`
  accessor is **gone** — `hasattr(bpy.data.actions.new("x"), "fcurves")` returns `False`. Code
  written against 4.3's `action.fcurves.new(...)` will raise `AttributeError` on 5.1.

**The version-safe pattern (works unchanged on 4.3 → 5.1): never touch `action.fcurves`
directly.** Use the high-level per-ID API:
```python
obj.keyframe_insert(data_path="location", index=0, frame=1)   # or pose_bone.keyframe_insert(...)
```
This transparently creates `animation_data` + `Action` + (on 4.4+) the slot/layer/strip/
channelbag, or (on 4.3) the flat fcurve — confirmed by the official `ActionSlot` doc's own
first example: *"Create animation data and an action... Slot will be automatically created."*
**[LIVE]** re-confirmed: after one `keyframe_insert` call, `action.is_action_legacy == False`,
`len(action.slots) == 1`, `len(action.layers) == 1`, and the slot's `identifier` was
auto-set to `"OBVerifyTestArmatureObj"` (an `"OB"` prefix + the object name — matches the
documented *"Identifiers start with a prefix based on the ID type, e.g. 'OB' for objects"*).

If a specific F-Curve is needed (not just "insert one keyframe"), the 4.4+-safe call is:
```python
fcurve = action.fcurve_ensure_for_datablock(datablock, data_path, index=0, group_name="")
```
[`bpy.types.Action.fcurve_ensure_for_datablock`, current] — *"Ensure that an F-Curve exists...
This function will also create the layer, keyframe strip, and action slot if necessary, and
take care of assigning the action slot too."* **[LIVE]** verified working. For a skill that
must run identically on the user's 4.3 and 5.1 installs, guard with
`hasattr(action, "fcurve_ensure_for_datablock")` and fall back to
`action.fcurves.find(...)`/`action.fcurves.new(...)` on the legacy branch — do not hardcode a
`bpy.app.version` tuple check, since the exact minor version this method first shipped in was
not independently verified in this research pass.

**Creating/assigning an Action:**
```python
action = bpy.data.actions.new("WalkCycle")   # BlendDataActions.new(name) -> Action
obj.animation_data_create()                    # ID.animation_data_create() -> AnimData | None
obj.animation_data.action = action             # AnimData.action
```
[`bpy.types.BlendDataActions.new`, `bpy.types.ID.animation_data_create`,
`bpy.types.AnimData.action` — all current, all **[LIVE]** exercised this session.]

**Fake users & "the action getting lost."** An `Action` (like any `ID`) is garbage-collected
on file reload/save once its user count drops to 0 — e.g. after `nla.action_pushdown` or
`nla.tweakmode_exit`, or after unassigning `AnimData.action`, an Action with no NLA strip
referencing it and no other user silently disappears at next load. `Action.use_fake_user`
(inherited from `ID.use_fake_user`) pins it. `bpy.ops.anim.clear_useless_actions
(only_unused=True)` is Blender's own janitor operator for the opposite case (deliberately
dropping actions with zero F-Curves). A pipeline script that builds a library of reusable
cycle actions should set `use_fake_user = True` immediately after creation, before anything
else can early-return/error and leave it orphaned.

**NLA — tracks and strips (pure data API, no operator needed for basic assembly):**
```python
track = obj.animation_data.nla_tracks.new()                 # NlaTracks.new(prev=None) -> NlaTrack
strip  = track.strips.new("WalkCycleStrip", start, action)  # NlaStrips.new(name, start, action) -> NlaStrip
```
[`bpy.types.NlaTracks.new`, `bpy.types.NlaStrips.new` — current, **[LIVE]** exercised.]
`strip.frame_end` is computed automatically from the action's frame range at creation time.
Key `NlaStrip` fields for layering (current API, all individually verified): `blend_type`
(`REPLACE|COMBINE|ADD|SUBTRACT|MULTIPLY`), `influence` (0-1), `extrapolation`
(`NOTHING|HOLD|HOLD_FORWARD`), `action_frame_start`/`action_frame_end` (source range inside the
action), `repeat` (float — see Cycles), `use_reverse`, `mute`. The equivalent one-shot operator
for "take the active action and push it down as a new strip" is
`bpy.ops.nla.action_pushdown(track_index=-1)`.

**Tweak mode** (edit an NLA strip's action in place, in context):
`bpy.ops.nla.tweakmode_enter(isolate_action=False, use_upper_stack_evaluation=False)` /
`bpy.ops.nla.tweakmode_exit(isolate_action=False)`. `AnimData.use_tweak_mode` mirrors the state
at the data level; `AnimData.action_tweak_storage` holds the action that was active before
entering tweak mode.

**Creating an IK constraint is pure data API — no operator, no context needed:**
```python
ik = pose_bone.constraints.new(type='IK')   # PoseBoneConstraints.new(type) -> Constraint (a KinematicConstraint)
```
[`bpy.types.PoseBoneConstraints.new`, current.] **[LIVE]** verified:
`type(ik).__name__ == 'KinematicConstraint'`; the literal string `'IK'` is confirmed present in
the live constraint-type enum read via
`bpy.types.Constraint.bl_rna.properties["type"].enum_items` →
`[..., 'DAMPED_TRACK', 'IK', 'LOCKED_TRACK', 'SPLINE_IK', ...]`. The equivalent UI/operator
path is `bpy.ops.pose.ik_add(with_targets=True)` ("Add an IK Constraint to the active Bone. The
target can be a selected bone or object") — prefer the data-API `.constraints.new('IK')` form
in scripts, since it has zero context/selection requirements.

**Key `KinematicConstraint` fields** (`bpy.types.KinematicConstraint`, current, each
individually verified against the bundled docs):
- `chain_count: int` — *"How many bones are included in the IK effect - 0 uses all bones."*
  `chain_count=2` on the end-effector bone gives a classic 2-bone arm/leg chain (that bone plus
  its parent).
- `target: Object`, `subtarget: str` — the IK goal; `subtarget` is a bone name on `target` (or
  a vertex group if `target` is a mesh), left `""` when `target` is a plain Object such as an
  Empty.
- `pole_target: Object`, `pole_subtarget: str`, `pole_angle: float` (radians, range ±π) — the
  pole/knee vector.
- `iterations: int` (0-10000), `use_stretch: bool`, `use_tail: bool` ("Include bone's tail as
  last element in chain"), `use_location`/`use_rotation: bool` ("Chain follows position/
  rotation of target"). Per-axis IK limits/stiffness (`lock_ik_x/y/z`, `ik_stiffness_x/y/z`,
  `ik_min/max_x/y/z`) live on `PoseBone`, not on the constraint itself.
- `ik_type: Literal['COPY_POSE', 'DISTANCE']` — **[LIVE]** confirmed only these two values
  exist; `'COPY_POSE'` is the default/standard chain-to-target mode, `'DISTANCE'` is the
  "stay within/outside/on a sphere" mode (paired with `distance`/`limit_mode`).

**IK target: animate the empty/bone, not the chain's FK rotations.** Once an IK constraint
exists, keyframe the **target object** (commonly an Empty) location/rotation — the constrained
bones' final pose comes from the solver and should not be keyframed directly (their
`rotation_quaternion`/`location` channels are meaningless while the IK constraint is driving
`.matrix`). If the IK result must be baked onto the bones' own channels (e.g. to disable the
constraint later, or to export FK-only data), that is exactly what Visual Keying/baking is for
(see Baking): `keyframe_insert(options={'INSERTKEY_VISUAL'})` per frame, or
`bpy.ops.nla.bake(visual_keying=True, clear_constraints=True, ...)` in bulk.

**IK/FK switching (arms vs. legs — a rigging pattern, not a dedicated bpy API):** the common
setup is two parallel bone chains (an IK chain with the constraint, a separate FK chain with
plain rotations) driven into one deform chain via Copy Rotation/Copy Transforms constraints
whose `influence` is wired to a single 0-1 "IK/FK blend" custom property. There is no Blender
operator that performs the switch generically; a script implements it by (1) matching one
chain's rotations to the other's current solved pose (via `Pose.apply_pose_from_action` or a
direct `matrix` read/convert), then (2) animating the blend property and the relevant
`Constraint.influence` F-Curves. Legs are almost always IK (foot planting/contact needs a
stable world-space target); arms are more often FK for broad acting poses, with IK reserved for
hand-plant/prop-interaction shots — this is a workflow convention, not an API distinction.

bundled docs + **[LIVE]** enum introspection); `bpy.ops.pose.ik_add` (current);
`manual/animation/constraints/tracking/ik_solver.rst` (5.1).*

## Cycles

**Walk/run cycle breakdown** (traditional-animation craft knowledge — cited to animation
references, not `docs.blender.org`, per the verification-discipline instructions). The
canonical 4-pose breakdown per step is **Contact → Down → Passing → Up**, then Contact again
on the opposite foot. At 24 fps a standard walk is commonly blocked as a 24-frame full cycle
(two steps = one second): contact poses at frames 0/12/24, with down/passing/up spaced at
roughly 3-frame increments within each contact-to-contact half-cycle. Faster/lighter walks and
runs compress this — a run cycle is commonly 8-16 frames total, sometimes collapsing the
"double contact" phase entirely into a single flight/passing-dominant silhouette. Treat these
counts as a starting ratio to retime against reference, not a fixed law.

**Mirroring poses in Blender (the "paste flipped" equivalent, reachable from Python):**
- `bpy.ops.pose.copy()` then `bpy.ops.pose.paste(flipped=True, selected_mask=False)` —
  *"Paste the stored pose flipped on to current pose."* Direct Python-reachable equivalent of
  the UI's Paste Pose Flipped.
- `bpy.ops.pose.select_mirror(only_active=False, extend=False)` — selects the mirrored bone
  set (relies on Blender's `.L`/`.R` or `_L`/`_R` naming-convention auto-detection) without
  changing any pose; useful before a manual flip.
- `bpy.ops.pose.flip_names(do_strip_numbers=False)` — flips left/right *name* suffixes only,
  no pose change.
- `bpy.ops.pose.quaternions_flip()` — not mirroring; fixes the double-cover interpolation
  artifact (see Posing & spaces).
- For a fully scripted mirror without the clipboard operators — e.g. building a symmetric pose
  programmatically from one side, or flipping an entire baked action — `Action.flip_with_pose
  (object)` (*"Flip the action around the X axis using a pose"*, current API on `Action`,
  taking the reference armature object as its argument) is the documented one-call path,
  useful for generating e.g. a "left-lead" walk variant from a "right-lead" one.

**Looping a cycle (two independent, composable mechanisms — verified live to interact
correctly):**
1. **Action-level intent flags:** `Action.use_frame_range = True` + `frame_start`/`frame_end`
   marks the action's *intended* playback range; `Action.use_cyclic = True` marks it as
   "intended to be used as a cycle" — the doc is explicit that **enabling this alone does not
   make anything loop**, it is a flag other tools/exporters read, and it feeds the
   `INSERTKEY_CYCLE_AWARE` keying option.
2. **NLA-strip-level (the actual repetition mechanism):** `NlaStrip.repeat: float`
   (0.1-1000, default 1.0). **[LIVE]** verified: creating a strip from a 12-frame action
   (frames 1-13) and setting `strip.repeat = 4.0` automatically recalculated `strip.frame_end`
   from `13` to `49` (`1 + (13-1)*4`) — the strip now plays the action four times back-to-back
   from a single float assignment. `NlaStrip.extrapolation` (`NOTHING|HOLD|HOLD_FORWARD`)
   controls what happens *past* the strip's own extent, independent of `repeat` (which controls
   repetition *within* the strip).

For a walk-cycle pipeline: author one 12-24 frame loop action with `use_cyclic=True` and a
matching `frame_start`/`frame_end`, push it to an NLA strip, and drive distance/speed by
adjusting `strip.repeat` (or `strip.scale` — *"Scaling factor for action"*, range
0.0001-1000, which retimes the same frame range faster/slower) rather than re-authoring keys.

## Baking

Two different, non-interchangeable baking entry points.

**1. Operator: `bpy.ops.nla.bake(...)`** — for use when a normal pose-mode/object-mode context
(selection, active object) is already set up.
```
bpy.ops.nla.bake(frame_start=1, frame_end=250, step=1, only_selected=True, visual_keying=False,
                  clear_constraints=False, clear_parents=False, use_current_action=False,
                  clean_curves=False, bake_types={'POSE'},
                  channel_types={'BBONE', 'LOCATION', 'PROPS', 'ROTATION', 'SCALE'})
```
[`bpy.ops.nla.bake`, current — the bundled docs cite the exact source location:
`scripts/startup/bl_operators/anim.py:274` on `projects.blender.org`.] Parameters that change
behavior meaningfully: `visual_keying=True` bakes the **final, constraint-evaluated** transform
(what you want when baking an IK chain down to plain FK keys); `clear_constraints=True` removes
constraints after baking, and the docs explicitly warn *"To get a correct bake with this
setting Visual Keying should be enabled"* — baking raw channels and then deleting the
constraint that was producing the real motion freezes the pre-constraint pose;
`use_current_action=True` bakes into the existing action instead of creating a new one (needed
when baking only a subset of bones in an armature that already has other animated bones);
`bake_types={'POSE'}` vs. `{'OBJECT'}` selects bone vs. object transforms — not mutually
exclusive, pass both to bake an animated object with animated bones in one call.

**2. Pure-Python module: `bpy_extras.anim_utils.bake_action(obj, *, action, frames,
bake_options)`** — for calling from a script **without any operator context at all** (no
active object / selection / mode requirement — the object is passed explicitly).
```python
from bpy_extras import anim_utils
opts = anim_utils.BakeOptions(
    only_selected=False, do_pose=True, do_object=False,
    do_visual_keying=True, do_constraint_clear=False, do_parents_clear=False,
    do_clean=False, do_location=True, do_rotation=True, do_scale=True,
    do_bbone=False, do_custom_props=False,
)
new_action = anim_utils.bake_action(obj, action=None, frames=range(1, 25), bake_options=opts)
```
**[LIVE]** verified this exact call shape via `inspect.signature` →
`(obj, *, action, frames, bake_options)`, and confirmed `BakeOptions` is a **dataclass with 12
required fields and no defaults** (`only_selected, do_pose, do_object, do_visual_keying,
do_constraint_clear, do_parents_clear, do_clean, do_location, do_rotation, do_scale, do_bbone,
do_custom_props`) — constructing it with zero arguments raises
`TypeError: missing 12 required positional arguments`. `action=None` bakes into a **new**
Action; pass an existing one to bake in place. `frames` accepts any int iterable (not just a
start/end/step triple) — e.g. `range(1, 25)` or an explicit sparse frame list, which the
operator form cannot do (it only accepts a contiguous start/end/step range).

Sibling coroutine variants exist for baking many objects together while yielding per-frame
(useful for a progress callback or interleaving with other per-frame work, without Blender's
own modal-operator loop): `bake_action_objects(object_action_pairs, *, frames, bake_options)`,
`bake_action_iter(obj, *, action, bake_options)`,
`bake_action_objects_iter(object_action_pairs, bake_options)`.

**When to use which:** the pure-Python `anim_utils.bake_action` is almost always the better
choice for an MCP/agent-driven script — it sidesteps every context-override problem in the next
section. Reach for the `bpy.ops.nla.bake` operator only when its UI-level side effects are
specifically wanted (e.g. it also drives NLA strip/track placement automatically) or when
baking is a direct translation of a recorded user macro.

*Sources: `bpy.ops.nla.bake` (current, with `projects.blender.org` source citation embedded in
the bundled docs); `bpy_extras.anim_utils` (current) — signature and dataclass shape
**[LIVE]**-verified against the connected 5.1.1 instance via `inspect.signature`/
`__dataclass_fields__`.*

## Context overrides

Most `bpy.ops.*` calls used above (`pose.breakdown`, `pose.paste`, `nla.action_pushdown`,
`object.mode_set`, ...) are **operators**: they read ambient `bpy.context` (active object,
mode, selection, active area/region) through a `poll()`/`execute()` pair designed for
interactive use, and raise `RuntimeError: Operator bpy.ops.X.Y poll() failed, context is
incorrect` when run from a background script if that context is not right.

**`bpy.context.temp_override(*, window=None, screen=None, area=None, region=None,
**keywords)`** [`bpy.types.Context.temp_override`, current] is a context manager that
temporarily patches arbitrary context members (not only the four named ones — `**keywords`
accepts any context attribute, confirmed by the official example passing
`selected_objects=my_objects`) for the duration of a `with` block, restoring the previous
values automatically — including on exception. Two official example shapes (verbatim from the
docs):
```python
# Redirect an operator to a specific window (e.g. running headless / no active window yet)
with context.temp_override(window=window):
    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add()
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')

# Override selection/active-object without touching the user's real selection
my_objects = [context.scene.camera]
with context.temp_override(selected_objects=my_objects) as override:
    bpy.ops.object.delete()
```
It also has a debugging hook: `override.logging_set(True, hide_missing=True)` inside the
`with` block prints every context member an operator actually reads — the fastest way to
discover what a failing operator needs, rather than guessing.

**Practical rule for this skill:** prefer `temp_override(active_object=..., selected_objects=
..., selected_pose_bones=...)` (or whichever members a specific operator's poll needs) over
manually mutating `view_layer.objects.active`/`obj.select_set(True)` and restoring them by hand
afterward — `temp_override` guarantees restoration even if the operator raises, whereas a
hand-rolled `try/finally` restore is one more place to introduce a bug (this session's own test
script had exactly such a bug — see Pitfalls).

**Real mode changes are not overridable this way.** `context.mode` is *derived from*
`active_object.mode`; there is no `temp_override(mode='POSE')` that fakes being in Pose Mode
without the object actually being in it. `bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='POSE')` genuinely
changes `obj.mode` and is not a pure context override. **[LIVE]** exercised repeatedly this
session (`mode_set(mode='EDIT')` to build bones via `armature.edit_bones`,
`mode_set(mode='POSE')` to select/pose bones and run `pose.rotation_mode_set`), always on a
freshly created, unlinked-until-tested object, always restored to `OBJECT` mode and the prior
active object/selection afterward.

**Which tasks are better done with pure data API (no operator, no context problem at all):**
- Creating constraints: `pose_bone.constraints.new(type=...)` — a plain collection method,
  works regardless of mode/selection/active object.
- Creating actions/NLA tracks/strips: `bpy.data.actions.new(...)`,
  `anim_data.nla_tracks.new()`, `track.strips.new(...)` — all plain data API.
- Keyframing: `obj.keyframe_insert(...)` / `pose_bone.keyframe_insert(...)` /
  `fcurve.keyframe_points.insert(...)` — plain data API (also why explicit keyframing is
  preferable to driving everything through `bpy.ops.anim.keyframe_insert()`, which depends on
  the active Keying Set).
- Baking: `bpy_extras.anim_utils.bake_action(obj, ...)` — takes the object as an argument; no
  ambient context needed at all (see Baking).
- Reading/writing poses: `pose_bone.matrix`/`.matrix_basis`, `Bone.convert_local_to_pose(...)`,
  `Object.convert_space(...)` — pure math, no context.

Operators remain the right (or only) tool for: breakdown/push/relax pose-blending
(`bpy.ops.pose.*` — these specifically operate on "current pose vs. neighboring keyed poses",
which has no plain data-API equivalent), mirroring via the pose clipboard
(`pose.copy`/`pose.paste`), and switching Edit/Pose/Object mode itself.

*Sources: `bpy.types.Context.temp_override` (current, both official examples reproduced
above); live execution this session (mode_set + edit_bones + pose selection, all on isolated
orphan data-blocks, fully cleaned up and verified removed).*

## Pitfalls

Ranked by how likely each is to bite a script that "looks correct" and silently produces wrong
animation:

1. **`PoseBone.matrix` is armature-object space, not world space.** Confusing the two is
   invisible until the armature object itself is moved/parented away from the world origin, at
   which point every "world-space" placement computed from raw `pose_bone.matrix` is offset by
   the armature's own transform. Fix: `Object.convert_space(pose_bone=pb, matrix=m,
   from_space='POSE', to_space='WORLD')` (verified callable **[LIVE]**).

2. **Changing `rotation_mode` never converts existing keyframes — confirmed by direct test,
   not assumption.** Live-tested both paths: the **operator**
   `bpy.ops.pose.rotation_mode_set(type='XYZ')` correctly converts the *current pose value*
   (quaternion → equivalent Euler, read back bit-exact) but leaves the old
   `rotation_quaternion` F-Curve untouched in the action and creates no new `rotation_euler`
   F-Curve — the bone's animation is silently broken at every *other* keyframe until a full
   manual re-key pass in the new mode. **Direct property assignment**
   (`pose_bone.rotation_mode = 'XYZ'`, no operator) behaves the same, minus even the
   current-frame display fix-up the operator does. Decide rotation mode per bone before keying
   anything.

3. **`Action.fcurves` does not exist from Blender 5.0 onward** (confirmed
   `hasattr(action, "fcurves") == False` **[LIVE]** on the connected 5.1.1). Code copied from a
   4.3-era tutorial that does `action.fcurves.new(...)` will `AttributeError` on the user's 5.1
   install. Use `keyframe_insert()` (works unchanged on both) or feature-detect
   `hasattr(action, "fcurve_ensure_for_datablock")` before falling back to the legacy accessor.

4. **Nested bone properties must be keyed through the owning ID, not the bone as if it were
   independent.** `pose_bone.keyframe_insert("rotation_quaternion")` happens to work because
   `PoseBone` resolves its own `id_data` correctly, but the resulting F-Curve's `data_path` is
   always `pose.bones["Name"].prop`, stored on the **Object's** action — there is no such thing
   as a bone with its own independent Action. Any raw `data_path` string built by hand (for
   `driver_add`/`keyframe_delete`/`fcurve_ensure_for_datablock`) must always be relative to the
   armature object, never to the bone.

5. **`INSERTKEY_VISUAL` / `visual_keying` matter enormously and are easy to leave off by
   default.** Baking or keying a constrained bone *without* visual keying captures the raw,
   pre-constraint channel (frozen at whatever it happened to be), not the motion visible on
   screen — and the `bpy.ops.nla.bake` docs explicitly warn that `clear_constraints=True`
   **without** `visual_keying=True` produces a bake that does not match the pre-bake animation.

6. **Auto-Keying is a scene-global toggle (`ToolSettings.use_keyframe_insert_auto`) a script
   should never rely on** — it depends on `context.scene.tool_settings` state the user may have
   on or off for unrelated reasons, changes which properties get keyed based on
   `auto_keying_mode` (`ADD_REPLACE_KEYS` vs. `REPLACE_KEYS` — per the identifiers themselves,
   the latter only touches F-Curves that already exist rather than creating new ones), and ties
   keying to *modifying a property through the UI/operators*, which a data-API script often
   does not trigger at all. Always call `keyframe_insert()` explicitly; to deliberately
   *reproduce* Blender's auto-key semantics (e.g. respecting locked channels), call
   `bpy_extras.anim_utils.AutoKeying.key_transformation(context, target)` rather than toggling
   the scene setting.

7. **Operators fail with an opaque `poll() failed` error when context is wrong, and the fix is
   almost never "add a temp_override for every context member you can think of."** Use
   `override.logging_set(True)` (see Context overrides) to see exactly which member is missing;
   and check first whether the task can be done with pure data API instead (constraints,
   actions, NLA, keyframing, baking, and pose-space conversions all can — see the list above).

8. **Low-level `FCurveKeyframePoints.insert()` inserts do not automatically get Bezier
   handles/interpolation "for free."** This only matters when inserting via the low-level
   F-Curve API instead of `keyframe_insert()` (which follows scene/tool defaults, typically
   Bezier in a default startup file) — a programmatic low-level insert that never explicitly
   sets `kf.interpolation = 'BEZIER'` can silently produce fully stepped (constant) animation
   instead of the smooth curve the caller assumed.

9. **A pushed-down/unassigned Action with no fake user and no NLA strip referencing it
   disappears on file reload, not immediately** — a script that builds a library of cycle
   actions, pushes each to NLA, then unassigns `animation_data.action` between builds, can pass
   every in-session check yet lose actions the moment the file is saved and reopened. Set
   `action.use_fake_user = True` at creation time for anything meant to persist as a reusable
   asset.

10. **`bake_action`'s `BakeOptions` has no defaults for any of its 12 fields** (dataclass,
    confirmed **[LIVE]** — `BakeOptions()` raises `TypeError`). Every field must be passed
    explicitly every time; there is no "just bake pose+visual, defaults for the rest"
    shortcut.

## Verified bpy snippets

Each snippet was checked against the cited docs; blocks marked **[LIVE]** were additionally
executed against the connected Blender 5.1.1 instance in this research session, on throwaway,
unlinked (or immediately-cleaned-up) data-blocks — none of this touched the user's actual file.

### 1. Explicit keyframing at an arbitrary frame, without moving the playhead

pose_bone.keyframe_insert(
    data_path="rotation_quaternion",
    frame=37,                      # explicit frame -- scene.frame_current is untouched
    group=bone_name,

### 5. IK constraint setup — pure data API, no context needed **[LIVE]**
```python
# docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.KinematicConstraint.html
# docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.PoseBoneConstraints.html
ik = arm_obj.pose.bones["Hand.L"].constraints.new(type='IK')

### 6. Version-safe Action creation + keying (works on 4.3 through 5.1)
```python
# docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.ID.html#bpy.types.ID.animation_data_create
# docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.BlendDataActions.html
action = bpy.data.actions.new("WalkCycle")
action.use_fake_user = True                    # survives reload with zero other users
obj.animation_data_create()
obj.animation_data.action = action
obj.keyframe_insert(data_path="location", frame=1)   # creates slot/layer/strip transparently on 4.4+
```

### 7. Version-safe direct F-Curve access (4.4+ path with legacy fallback)
```python
# docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.Action.html#bpy.types.Action.fcurve_ensure_for_datablock
# developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.4/upgrading/slotted_actions/  (legacy API removed by 5.0)
if hasattr(action, "fcurve_ensure_for_datablock"):
    fcurve = action.fcurve_ensure_for_datablock(obj, "location", index=0)
else:
    fcurve = action.fcurves.find("location", index=0) or action.fcurves.new("location", index=0)
```

### 8. NLA track + looping cycle strip **[LIVE]**
```python
# docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.NlaTracks.html
# docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.NlaStrips.html
# docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.NlaStrip.html
action.use_frame_range = True
action.frame_start, action.frame_end = 1, 13
action.use_cyclic = True

track = obj.animation_data.nla_tracks.new()
strip = track.strips.new("WalkCycleStrip", 1, action)
strip.repeat = 4.0            # frame_end auto-recalculates: 1 + (13-1)*4 = 49
strip.extrapolation = 'HOLD'
```

### 9. Baking without any operator/context dependency **[LIVE]**
```python
# docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy_extras.anim_utils.html
from bpy_extras import anim_utils
opts = anim_utils.BakeOptions(
    only_selected=False, do_pose=True, do_object=False,
    do_visual_keying=True, do_constraint_clear=False, do_parents_clear=False,
    do_clean=True, do_location=True, do_rotation=True, do_scale=True,
    do_bbone=False, do_custom_props=False,
)
baked_action = anim_utils.bake_action(arm_obj, action=None, frames=range(1, 25), bake_options=opts)
```

### 10. Context override for an operator needing a specific active object/selection, without touching the user's real state
```python
# docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.Context.html#bpy.types.Context.temp_override
with bpy.context.temp_override(active_object=arm_obj, selected_objects=[arm_obj]):
    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='POSE')
```

### 11. Mirroring a pose (Paste Flipped equivalent)
```python
# docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.ops.pose.html  (copy / paste)
bpy.ops.pose.copy()
bpy.ops.pose.paste(flipped=True, selected_mask=False)
```

4.3-era / historical API confirmation (WebSearch-extracted text from archived
`docs.blender.org/api/...` version pages — WebFetch to `docs.blender.org` returned HTTP 403
site-wide in this session for every URL tried, including the bare `/api/current/` index, so
none of the `docs.blender.org` citations in this report were fetched directly; all came either
from the Blender MCP server's bundled RST mirror or from WebSearch's extracted page text):

**Live execution evidence:** every snippet marked **[LIVE]** was run in this session against
the connected Blender 5.1.1 instance via the `execute_blender_code` MCP tool, exclusively on
newly created, unlinked (or immediately-cleaned-up) armature/object/action data-blocks. No user
scene data was modified; each test's `finally` block was confirmed via a follow-up `bpy.data`
existence check to have fully removed the throwaway data-blocks (armatures, objects, and
actions), and any transient selection/active-object/mode change made to exercise Edit/Pose-mode
operators was restored to its prior state afterward.
