# A3 — Physics simulations as animation in Blender (rigid body, cloth, soft body, particles)

**Scope**: programmatic (bpy-only, no UI) authoring of physics-driven animation for the
`blender-animation` skill, executed through an MCP bridge into a live Blender instance.
No UI interaction is assumed available.

**Verification method used in this pass** (stated up front per the verification-discipline
requirement): this Blender install has two versions on disk — Blender 4.3's *data folder*
(`C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 4.3\4.3\`, config/scripts only) but **no 4.3
executable** was found anywhere on the machine — and a fully working **Blender 5.1.1**
(hash `b70da489d7f4`, built 2026-04-14, at `C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 5.1\blender.exe`).
Given a working executable, every non-trivial claim below was verified two ways:

1. **Live empirical execution** — real `bpy` code run via `blender.exe --background --python <script>.py`
   against the actual Blender 5.1.1 process (not memory, not guesswork). This is strictly stronger
   than reading docs for the notoriously context-fragile operators this brief called out.
2. **Official API docs** — the MCP server's bundled Blender Python API reference (RST files
   mirroring `docs.blender.org/api/`), cross-checked live against the running 5.1.1 (its enums/props
   matched the bundled docs exactly wherever both were available), plus `docs.blender.org`/
   `developer.blender.org` release notes reached through the search tool (direct `WebFetch` to both
   `developer.blender.org` and `docs.blender.org` was blocked with HTTP 403 in this sandbox — every
   citation to those domains below is therefore via the search tool's own fetch, not a raw page dump).

**Version honesty**: everything marked "empirically verified" was run against **5.1.1**, not 4.3.
Where a 4.3-vs-5.x difference matters, it is called out explicitly with its source (release notes,
or the absence/presence of a property/operator). No 4.3 behavior is asserted from memory alone —
where I could not diff it, I say so.

Blender's own installed files were also read directly as ground truth where relevant (e.g. the five
built-in cloth presets, read verbatim from `...\Blender 5.1\5.1\scripts\presets\cloth\*.py`).

## Rigid body

### Adding objects to the rigid body world

There is **no data-API constructor** for a rigid body — `bpy.types.RigidBodyObject()` raises
`TypeError: bpy_struct.__new__(struct): expected a single argument` (empirically confirmed). The
only way to attach rigid-body physics to an object is the operator:

```python
bpy.ops.rigidbody.object_add(type='ACTIVE')   # or type='PASSIVE'
```

Doc: `bpy.ops.rigidbody.object_add(*, type='ACTIVE')` — [bpy.ops.rigidbody](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.ops.rigidbody.html) (bundled RST `api/bpy.ops.rigidbody.rst`, confirmed identical against live 5.1.1 introspection).

**Empirically verified: this works from a pure headless script with zero context override** —
it only needs `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` set to the target object (selection is not
even required for the single-object form). Tested directly in `--background` mode:

```
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(location=(0, 0, 5))
cube = bpy.context.active_object
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = cube
bpy.ops.rigidbody.object_add(type='ACTIVE')     # -> {'FINISHED'}, no override needed
```

If `scene.rigidbody_world` does not exist yet, `object_add` **auto-creates it** (confirmed:
`scene.rigidbody_world is None` before the call, a populated `RigidBodyWorld` with a fresh
`Collection` named `"RigidBodyWorld"` after). This matches the plural form too:
`bpy.ops.rigidbody.objects_add(type='ACTIVE')` adds all *selected* objects at once.

Full `bpy.ops.rigidbody` operator set (bundled doc + live-confirmed identical to the connected
5.1.1; source lines cite Blender's own repo at `scripts/startup/bl_operators/rigidbody.py`):

| Operator | Signature | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `object_add` | `(type='ACTIVE')` | active object only |
| `objects_add` | `(type='ACTIVE')` | all selected |
| `object_remove` / `objects_remove` | `()` | |
| `object_settings_copy` | `()` | copies active object's RB settings to other selected |
| `world_add` / `world_remove` | `()` | manual world management (usually auto-handled) |
| `constraint_add` | `(type='FIXED')` | adds a `RigidBodyConstraint` to the **active object** (normally an Empty) |
| `constraint_remove` | `()` | |
| `connect` | `(con_type='FIXED', pivot_type='CENTER', connection_pattern='SELECTED_TO_ACTIVE')` | bulk-generates constraint objects between selected rigid bodies (`SELECTED_TO_ACTIVE` or `CHAIN_DISTANCE`) — this is the fast path for e.g. procedural chains or shatter-glue, avoids hand-adding N empties |
| `shape_change` | `(type='MESH')` | bulk collision-shape change for selected objects |
| `mass_calculate` | `(material='DEFAULT', density=1.0)` | see gotcha below — `'DEFAULT'` is **not** a real enum value |
| `bake_to_keyframes` | `(frame_start=1, frame_end=250, step=1)` | see **Caching & baking** — fails headlessly |

### Active vs. passive, collision shapes, physical properties

`RigidBodyObject` (`obj.rigid_body`) properties — enumerated **live** from the running 5.1.1's
`bl_rna` (`bpy.types.RigidBodyObject.bl_rna.properties`), which is the actual ground truth the
Python API exposes, not a doc paraphrase:

```
angular_damping, collision_collections, collision_margin, collision_shape,
deactivate_angular_velocity, deactivate_linear_velocity, enabled, friction,
kinematic, linear_damping, mass, mesh_source, restitution, type,
use_deactivation, use_deform, use_margin, use_start_deactivated
```

- `type` enum (live-confirmed): `ACTIVE`, `PASSIVE`.
- `collision_shape` enum (live-confirmed, exact order): `BOX`, `SPHERE`, `CAPSULE`, `CYLINDER`,
  `CONE`, `CONVEX_HULL`, `MESH`, `COMPOUND`.
- `mesh_source` enum (only meaningful for `MESH`/`CONVEX_HULL` shapes; live-confirmed):
  `BASE`, `DEFORM`, `FINAL`. This controls whether the collision geometry tracks
  modifier-deformed geometry every frame (`DEFORM`/`FINAL`, more expensive) or stays static
  from the base mesh (`BASE`) — relevant if the rigid body object also carries a Cloth,
  Armature, or other deforming modifier.
- `restitution` is Blender's name for **bounciness** (0 = no bounce, 1 = perfectly elastic).
- `friction`, `mass`, `linear_damping`/`angular_damping`, `collision_margin` (+ `use_margin`)
  are all direct floats on `rigid_body`, no operator needed to set them once added.
- **No settable velocity property exists** — there is no `linear_velocity` / `angular_velocity`
  field on `RigidBodyObject` (empirically confirmed by enumerating all properties and checking
  for any of `linear_velocity`/`angular_velocity`/`velocity` — none present). This directly answers
  research question 9: the *only* way to give a rigid body an initial velocity from script is the
  kinematic-keyframe handoff (see **Hybrid keyframe+physics** below) — there is no "just set the
  velocity" shortcut.

### `RigidBodyWorld` (the scene's simulation container)

`scene.rigidbody_world` properties, live-confirmed on 5.1.1 (and identical to the bundled doc):
`collection`, `constraints`, `effector_weights`, `enabled`, `point_cache`, `solver_iterations`
(int, default 10), `substeps_per_frame` (int, default 10), `time_scale` (float, default 1.0),
`use_split_impulse` (bool, default False).

**Version gotcha (important):** older Blender docs/tutorials refer to `rigidbody_world.steps_per_second`.
That property **does not exist** in the connected 5.1.1 — `getattr(rbw, 'steps_per_second', ...)`
raises `AttributeError`. It has been renamed **`substeps_per_frame`** ("Number of simulation steps
taken per frame"). I could not pin the exact version this rename landed in (the bundled offline docs
and the live 5.1.1 already agree on `substeps_per_frame`; I did not have a 4.3 executable to diff
against directly). For version-safe code, don't hard-code either name:

```python
def get_substeps(rbw):
    for name in ('substeps_per_frame', 'steps_per_second'):
        if hasattr(rbw, name):
            return getattr(rbw, name)
    return 10
```

`collection` is the `Collection` holding every simulated object; `constraints` is a **separate**
`Collection` holding constraint Empties (it is `None` until the first constraint is added — live-confirmed).
`point_cache` is never `None` (`PointCache` datablock, covered in **Caching & baking**).

### Constraints (hinge, fixed, spring, ...)

A rigid body constraint is **not** a property of a physics object — it's a separate Empty object
carrying a `RigidBodyConstraint` (`obj.rigid_body_constraint`), created via:

```python
bpy.ops.object.empty_add(location=pivot)
con_obj = bpy.context.active_object
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = con_obj
bpy.ops.rigidbody.constraint_add(type='HINGE')   # con_obj.rigid_body_constraint now exists
con = con_obj.rigid_body_constraint
con.object1 = obj_a
con.object2 = obj_b
```

`type` enum (live-confirmed on `RigidBodyConstraint`, exact list): `FIXED`, `POINT`, `HINGE`,
`SLIDER`, `PISTON`, `GENERIC`, `GENERIC_SPRING`, `MOTOR`.
`spring_type` enum (for `GENERIC_SPRING`, live-confirmed): `SPRING1`, `SPRING2`.

Full `RigidBodyConstraint` property surface (live-enumerated, 47 fields) includes per-axis
linear/angular limits (`limit_lin_x_lower/upper`, `limit_ang_x_lower/upper`, ... for x/y/z each),
their `use_limit_*` toggles, `use_breaking` + `breaking_threshold` (impulse at which the joint
snaps), `object1`/`object2`, `solver_iterations` + `use_override_solver_iterations`, and per-axis
`spring_stiffness_*`/`spring_damping_*` (linear and angular) for `GENERIC_SPRING`, plus
`motor_lin_target_velocity`/`motor_lin_max_impulse` and their angular counterparts for `MOTOR`.

I could not empirically pin **which single local axis** a `HINGE` constraint actually rotates
around from the RNA alone — freshly created `HINGE`/`SLIDER` constraints have all `use_limit_*`
flags `False` and all three angular-limit pairs identical (±45°) by default, so the "free" axis
isn't visible as a toggled flag; it's baked into Blender's Bullet-constraint-type selection in C,
not exposed as a settable "which axis" property. The Blender manual states the Z axis is the
Hinge's rotation axis and X is used by Slider/Piston for translation — cited via search, not
independently re-derived by a rotation test in this pass, so treat it as manual-sourced rather
than empirically proven here: [Hinge Constraint — Blender Manual](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/physics/rigid_body/constraints/types/hinge.html).

### Mass calculation

```python
bpy.ops.rigidbody.mass_calculate(material='Custom', density=1.0)
```

**Gotcha, empirically caught**: the operator's own docstring says `material: Literal['DEFAULT']`
— that is misleading/incomplete. Calling it with `material='DEFAULT'` raises:
`TypeError: ... enum "DEFAULT" not found in (...)`. The **real, live enum** is a ~45-item list of
named real-world materials (`Air`, `Acrylic`, `Asphalt (Crushed)`, `Brass`, `Brick (Pressed)`,
`Concrete`, `Glass (Solid)`, `Gold`, `Steel`, `Wood`... through `Custom`). Use `'Custom'` with an
explicit `density` to get a precise, script-controlled mass.

**Empirically verified**: `mass_calculate` correctly uses the object's **world-space (scaled)
volume**, not the raw local-mesh volume — a base 2×2×2 cube scaled `(1,1,3)` (world volume 24)
gave `mass = 24.0` at `density=1.0` whether or not the scale had been `transform_apply`'d first.
This is one of the very few places where un-applied scale demonstrably does **not** bite (see
**Determinism & scale gotchas**).

Doc: `bpy.ops.rigidbody.mass_calculate(*, material='DEFAULT', density=1.0)` — bundled `api/bpy.ops.rigidbody.rst`, live enum list confirmed by direct call.
## Caching & baking

This is the section the brief specifically flagged as "notoriously context-dependent from
scripts" — and empirical testing confirmed exactly that, with a precise, verified fix.

### The point cache

`scene.rigidbody_world.point_cache` is a `PointCache` (never `None`) with `frame_start`,
`frame_end` (defaults 1/250, live-confirmed), `frame_step`, `is_baked`, `is_baking`,
`is_frame_skip`, `is_outdated`, `use_disk_cache`, `filepath`. The identical `PointCache` type is
shared by rigid body world, `ClothModifier`, `SoftBodyModifier`, `ParticleSystem`, and
`DynamicPaintSurface` (confirmed via the type's own "References" list in the bundled docs) — so
everything below about the context-override pattern for rigid body applies unchanged to cloth/
soft body/particle point caches, since it's the exact same `bpy.ops.ptcache.*` API operating on
the exact same `PointCache` struct type, just reached via a different owner (`modifier.point_cache`
/ `psys.point_cache` instead of `rigidbody_world.point_cache`).

Doc: [bpy.types.PointCache](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.PointCache.html) (bundled `api/bpy.types.PointCache.rst`).

### `bpy.ops.ptcache.bake` — reproduced failure and the verified fix

Calling it naively from a script **fails**, reproduced directly:

```python
>>> bpy.ops.ptcache.bake(bake=True)
RuntimeError: Operator bpy.ops.ptcache.bake.poll() failed, context is incorrect
```

**Verified working fix** — supply the `point_cache` context member via `temp_override`:

```python
rbw = bpy.context.scene.rigidbody_world
with bpy.context.temp_override(point_cache=rbw.point_cache):
    bpy.ops.ptcache.bake(bake=True)          # -> {'FINISHED'}
# rbw.point_cache.is_baked is now True
```

This was empirically run end-to-end in `--background` mode with **no other context members**
needed — just `point_cache` in the override. (A second attempt additionally supplying
`active_object`/`scene` also succeeded, but they weren't necessary; `point_cache` alone was
sufficient.) Doc for the operator itself: `bpy.ops.ptcache.bake(*, bake=False)` — bundled
`api/bpy.ops.ptcache.rst`.

Related operators in the same module (all share the same context requirement, not individually
re-tested beyond `bake`): `bake_all(bake=True)`, `bake_from_cache()`, `free_bake()`,
`free_bake_all()`, `add()`, `remove()`.

### Is manual `scene.frame_set()` stepping a valid alternative to baking? — Yes, verified

Stepping the frame range yourself, with **no baking and no context override at all**, correctly
drives rigid body (and cloth — see below) simulation and leaves the point cache in the same
`is_baked = True` state:

```python
scene.frame_set(scene.frame_start)
for f in range(scene.frame_start, scene.frame_end + 1):
    scene.frame_set(f)
    # read obj.matrix_world / evaluated mesh here if needed
```

Empirically verified on a falling cube: it descended from z=5.0 to a settled rest at z≈1.0 (correct
for a half-height-1 cube resting on a z=0 plane) purely from repeated `frame_set()` calls, and
`rigidbody_world.point_cache.is_baked` was `True` afterward — Blender's cache system considers a
fully frame-stepped range "baked" the same as an explicit `ptcache.bake` call. This is the
simplest possible pattern and needs zero context tricks, so it's the recommended default for a
script/MCP context whenever you don't need a disk-persisted cache file.

### `bpy.ops.rigidbody.bake_to_keyframes` — fails headlessly; this is a known Blender bug, not user error

Doc/signature (bundled `api/bpy.ops.rigidbody.rst`, source `scripts/startup/bl_operators/rigidbody.py:108`):

```python
bpy.ops.rigidbody.bake_to_keyframes(frame_start=1, frame_end=250, step=1)
```

**Empirically reproduced failure**, called correctly (selection + active object both set,
rigid-body world already simulating fine via manual stepping moments earlier in the same script):

```
RuntimeError: Error: Python: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".../scripts/startup/bl_operators/rigidbody.py", line 165, in execute
    bpy.ops.anim.keyframe_insert_by_name(type='BUILTIN_KSI_LocRot')
RuntimeError: Operator bpy.ops.anim.keyframe_insert_by_name.poll() failed, context is incorrect
```

`bake_to_keyframes` is a **Python-defined** operator that internally calls a *second* operator
(`anim.keyframe_insert_by_name`) via `bpy.ops`. I tried rescuing it with increasingly complete
`temp_override`s — `point_cache` + `active_object` + `scene` + `selected_objects`, then additionally
a real `window`/`screen`/`area`(`VIEW_3D`)/`region` pulled from `bpy.context.window` itself (which,
interestingly, **does exist** even in `--background` mode — `bpy.context.window` and
`bpy.context.screen` ("Layout") are real objects there; only `bpy.context.area` is `None`). None of
these overrides fixed it; the inner `keyframe_insert_by_name` call kept failing identically.

This matches a **known, tracked upstream limitation**, not a mistake in the override: overriding
context on an outer Python operator does not propagate into `bpy.ops.*` calls that operator makes
internally. Corroborated via two Blender bug-tracker reports (retrieved via search; direct
`WebFetch` to `developer.blender.org` was blocked with HTTP 403 in this sandbox, so these are
cited as search-tool-sourced corroboration of my own independent empirical repro, not a verbatim
ticket read):

- `T63067` — "Overriding context in rigidbody operations [override not passed along in
  startup/bl_operators that themselves call bpy.ops]"
- `T97382` — "Context error when running bpy.ops.rigidbody.bake_to_keyframes() thru cmd"

**Practical conclusion for this skill**: do not build the physics-baking workflow around
`rigidbody.bake_to_keyframes`. It is confirmed broken in pure `--background` execution. Whether it
happens to work when the MCP bridge executes code inside a genuinely live GUI Blender session (this
skill's actual target) depends on whether `bpy.context.area` is a valid, correctly-typed area at the
exact moment the bridge's code runs — I could not test this (no live GUI instance was connected
during this research pass; the MCP `execute_blender_code` tool errored with "Cannot connect to
Blender at localhost:9876" throughout). Treat it as **unverified-in-the-live-GUI-case, confirmed-broken-headless**,
and default to one of the two robust alternatives below regardless, since both are proven to work
in every context tested (they never call `bpy.ops` internally for the risky part).

### Robust alternative #1 (recommended default): `bpy_extras.anim_utils.bake_action`

Blender ships this as pure-Python, data-API-only utility (it's what backs the "Bake Action" NLA
tool). Doc: `bpy_extras.anim_utils.bake_action(obj, *, action, frames, bake_options)` +
`anim_utils.BakeOptions(only_selected, do_pose, do_object, do_visual_keying, do_constraint_clear,
do_parents_clear, do_clean, do_location, do_rotation, do_scale, do_bbone, do_custom_props)` —
bundled `api/bpy_extras.anim_utils.rst`.

**Empirically verified working, zero context override, in pure `--background` mode:**

```python
from bpy_extras import anim_utils
action = anim_utils.bake_action(
    obj, action=None, frames=range(1, 21),
    bake_options=anim_utils.BakeOptions(
        only_selected=False, do_pose=False, do_object=True, do_visual_keying=True,
        do_constraint_clear=False, do_parents_clear=False, do_clean=False,
        do_location=True, do_rotation=True, do_scale=False, do_bbone=False, do_custom_props=False,
    ),
)
```

Result confirmed: a real `Action` gets created and assigned, with F-curves on exactly
`location` and `rotation_euler` (matching the object's `rotation_mode`) — i.e. functionally
identical output to what `bake_to_keyframes` is *supposed* to produce, reached through a path
that never breaks headlessly.

### Robust alternative #2 (simplest, no helper import): manual per-frame `keyframe_insert`

`bpy_struct.keyframe_insert(data_path, *, index=-1, frame=..., group="", options=set(),
keytype='KEYFRAME') -> bool` is a plain **data-API method**, not an operator — it has no `poll()`
and no context dependency at all. Doc: bundled `api/bpy.types.bpy_struct.rst`.

```python
for f in range(frame_start, frame_end + 1):
    scene.frame_set(f)
    obj.keyframe_insert(data_path="location", frame=f)
    obj.keyframe_insert(data_path="rotation_euler", frame=f)
```

Empirically verified working in `--background` with no import, no override.

### Cache invalidation gotcha (empirically encountered, not just theoretical)

Adding a **new** rigid body object to `scene.rigidbody_world.collection` *after* the world's point
cache has already been stepped/baked across a frame range, then jumping back to frame 1 and
re-stepping, produced a clearly wrong result in testing (an object that should have rested on a
floor instead fell to roughly -6.6 units, i.e. straight through the floor with no collision
response at all). Isolating the exact same object/scale setup in a **fresh, single-purpose Blender
process** (no prior rigid-body stepping in that process) gave the correct resting position every
time. This strongly suggests the point cache became stale/inconsistent for the newly-added object
once other objects' frames were already cached — consistent with Blender's cache being scene-wide
and frame-indexed (confirmed structurally: `point_cache` lives once on `rigidbody_world`, shared by
the whole `collection`), though I did not isolate the exact internal mechanism further. **Practical
rule verified by A/B testing**: don't accumulate multiple unrelated rigid-body experiments in one
long-lived scene/script without freeing the cache (`ptcache.free_bake_all()` under the same
`point_cache` override, or rebuild the rigidbody world) between them — each independent simulation
setup got a clean result only when run in its own fresh process/scene.
## Cloth

### Adding the modifier

```python
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = mesh_obj
bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='CLOTH')
```

Empirically verified working headlessly with `{'FINISHED'}`. Doc:
`bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(*, type='SUBSURF', use_selected_objects=False)` — bundled
`api/bpy.ops.object.rst` (definition block); default `type` is `SUBSURF`, so `type='CLOTH'` must
always be passed explicitly. The modifier is created with the **default name `"Cloth"`**
(live-confirmed: `obj.modifiers['Cloth']`).

There is no lower-level data-API way to add a Cloth modifier other than through this operator
(consistent with every other modifier type — modifiers in general are only addable via
`object.modifier_add` or `object.modifiers.new(name, type)`; both were not separately diffed here
since the operator path was already confirmed sufficient).

The modifier exposes **two separate sub-structs**, easy to conflate:

- `modifiers["Cloth"].settings` → `ClothSettings` — the *fabric* itself (mass, stiffness, pressure...).
- `modifiers["Cloth"].collision_settings` → `ClothCollisionSettings` — how *this* cloth reacts to
  collision objects and to itself (self-collision).

### `ClothSettings` — full verified field list (bundled `api/bpy.types.ClothSettings.rst`)

Core fabric-feel parameters (all confirmed present, with their documented ranges/defaults):

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `quality` | 5 | solver steps per frame (higher = better/slower) |
| `mass` | 0.3 | mass per vertex |
| `air_damping` | 1.0 | air drag on the whole sheet |
| `tension_stiffness` / `_max` | 15.0 | resists stretching |
| `compression_stiffness` / `_max` | 15.0 | resists compression |
| `shear_stiffness` / `_max` | 5.0 | resists shearing |
| `bending_stiffness` / `_max` | 0.5 | resists folding/creasing |
| `tension_damping`, `compression_damping`, `shear_damping`, `bending_damping` | 5.0/5.0/5.0/0.5 | damping per spring type |
| `bending_model` | `'ANGULAR'` | `ANGULAR` (default) or `LINEAR` (legacy) |
| `use_internal_springs` + `internal_*` fields | off | simulate an internal volume structure (connects opposite sides through the mesh) |
| `use_pressure` + `uniform_pressure_force`, `target_volume`, `pressure_factor`, `use_pressure_volume`, `fluid_density` | off | closed-mesh "balloon" pressure simulation |
| `shrink_min` / `shrink_max` | 0.0 | shrink the cloth by a factor |
| `use_sewing_springs` + `sewing_force_max` | off | pulls loose/sewn edges together (garment seams) |
| `vertex_group_mass` | `""` | **this is the pin group** (see below) |
| `vertex_group_bending`, `vertex_group_intern`, `vertex_group_pressure`, `vertex_group_shear_stiffness`, `vertex_group_shrink`, `vertex_group_structural_stiffness` | `""` | spatially-varying overrides for each of those parameters |
| `goal_default`, `goal_min`, `goal_max`, `goal_spring`, `goal_friction` | 0/0/1/1.0/0 | legacy "reactor"-style goal pinning; superseded by `vertex_group_mass` pinning for most uses |
| `rest_shape_key` | `None` | use a Shape Key as the rest/reference geometry instead of the base mesh (useful for sewing patterns / pre-shaped garments) |
| `gravity` | `(0, 0, -9.81)` | **cloth has its own gravity override**, independent of `scene.gravity` — see Determinism section |
| `voxel_cell_size` | 0.1 | self-collision broad-phase grid cell size |
| `effector_weights` | — | force-field response (wind, turbulence, etc.) |
| `time_scale` | 1.0 | speeds up/slows down the sim relative to scene time |
| `use_dynamic_mesh` | off | make the sim respect base-mesh deformation from other modifiers |

### `ClothCollisionSettings` — live-enumerated fields (`modifiers["Cloth"].collision_settings`)

```
collection, collision_quality, damping, distance_min, friction, impulse_clamp,
self_distance_min, self_friction, self_impulse_clamp, use_collision, use_self_collision,
vertex_group_object_collisions, vertex_group_self_collisions
```

`use_collision`/`use_self_collision` are the master toggles; `distance_min`/`self_distance_min`
are the minimum-separation distances (Blender's cloth-vs-collider buffer, distinct from the
collider's own `thickness_outer`, see below); `collision_quality` is the collision solver's own
substep count, separate from `settings.quality`.

### Pin groups (vertex groups + weights) — empirically verified end to end

```python
vg = obj.vertex_groups.new(name="Pin")
vg.add([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1.0, 'REPLACE')          # index list, weight, assign mode
obj.modifiers["Cloth"].settings.vertex_group_mass = vg.name
```

`VertexGroup.add(index, weight, type)` doc (bundled `api/bpy.types.VertexGroup.rst`): `index` is a
**list** of vertex indices (not one call per vertex — batch them), `weight` a single float applied
to all listed indices, `type` one of `REPLACE`/`ADD`/`SUBTRACT`.

Verified on an actual falling/draping cloth plane: over 20 stepped frames, the pinned top-row
vertices stayed at **exactly** `z = 0.0` the entire time while the unpinned bottom of the sheet
sagged progressively down to `z ≈ -1.47` — direct proof the pin group correctly held those
vertices in place while the rest simulated freely.

### Collision objects (the *other* side — what cloth collides against)

```python
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = floor_obj
bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='COLLISION')
```

This exposes `floor_obj.collision` → `CollisionSettings` (**not** on a modifier sub-struct this
time — it's directly on the object), live-enumerated fields:

```
absorption, cloth_friction, damping, damping_factor, damping_random, friction_factor,
friction_random, permeability, stickiness, thickness_inner, thickness_outer,
use, use_culling, use_normal, use_particle_kill
```

`use` is the master enable toggle; `thickness_outer`/`thickness_inner` define the collision-shell
offset from the mesh surface (inner only matters for soft bodies passing through, per its own doc
string); `cloth_friction` is specifically the friction cloth feels against this collider (separate
from the particle-oriented `friction_factor`/`damping_factor`, which are for particle systems, not
cloth).

### Presets — exact values (read directly from Blender's own installed files, not estimated)

Blender ships five built-in cloth presets as plain Python scripts at
`...\Blender 5.1\5.1\scripts\presets\cloth\{Cotton,Denim,Leather,Rubber,Silk}.py`. Read verbatim
(these are the literal, authoritative numbers Blender's own "Cotton"/"Silk"/etc. preset menu
entries apply):

| Preset | quality | mass | tension/compression/shear stiffness | bending_stiffness | tension/compression/shear damping | air_damping |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cotton | 5 | 0.300 | 15 / 15 / 15 | 0.5 | 5 / 5 / 5 | 1.0 |
| Denim | 12 | 1 | 40 / 40 / 40 | 10 | 25 / 25 / 25 | 1 |
| Leather | 15 | 0.4 | 80 / 80 / 80 | 150 | 25 / 25 / 25 | 1 |
| Rubber | 7 | 3 | 15 / 15 / 15 | 25 | 25 / 25 / 25 | 1 |
| Silk | 5 | 0.150 | 5 / 5 / 5 | 0.05 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 1 |

(All five also set the same pressure defaults — `use_pressure=False`, `uniform_pressure_force=76.0`,
`target_volume=0.0`, `pressure_factor=1.0`, `fluid_density=0.0` — and the same
`internal_*` defaults; those fields aren't preset-differentiated.)

Reading this table: heavier/stiffer materials (Leather, Denim) pair high stiffness (40–80) with
high damping (25) and higher quality steps (12–15); Silk pairs low stiffness (5) with **zero**
damping and the cheapest quality (5); Rubber is the outlier — very high mass (3) but only
mid-range stretch stiffness, with `bending_stiffness` (25) much higher than Cotton's (0.5), i.e.
it resists *folding* far more than it resists stretching, giving a springy-sheet rather than a
drapey-fabric feel.

**Gotcha — do not call Blender's preset-execute operator from a headless script.** Every preset
file above uses `bpy.context.cloth.settings.X = value`, i.e. it expects a `context.cloth` context
member — the exact same context-member pattern that `ptcache.bake` needed `point_cache` for. Since
this was independently confirmed to be a fragile pattern for `ptcache.bake` (see **Caching &
baking**), the reliable approach is to **not** invoke `bpy.ops.script.execute_preset(...)` at all
and instead set the numeric fields on `modifiers["Cloth"].settings` directly using the table above.

### Cloth deformation — verified computable via plain frame-stepping, no baking needed

```python
depsgraph = bpy.context.evaluated_depsgraph_get()
for f in range(1, 21):
    scene.frame_set(f)
    depsgraph = bpy.context.evaluated_depsgraph_get()
    obj_eval = cloth_obj.evaluated_get(depsgraph)
    mesh_eval = obj_eval.to_mesh()
    zs = [v.co.z for v in mesh_eval.vertices]
    obj_eval.to_mesh_clear()          # free the temporary evaluated mesh
```

This is the exact pattern used to obtain the pin-group proof above; it needs no cache/bake call at
all — the depsgraph evaluation triggers the cloth solver to compute that frame's state on demand.
`to_mesh_clear()` after use is standard Blender hygiene to release the temporary mesh (not
independently torn down and diffed in this pass, but it's the documented cleanup call for
`evaluated_get().to_mesh()`).
## Soft body

### Adding the modifier

```python
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = obj
bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='SOFT_BODY')
```

Empirically verified working headlessly. **Gotcha**: the created modifier is named
`"Softbody"` (one word, lowercase `b`) — live-confirmed via `obj.modifiers['Softbody']`; guessing
`"Soft Body"` or `"SoftBody"` will `KeyError`.

### `SoftBodySettings` — full field list (bundled `api/bpy.types.SoftBodySettings.rst`)

Pinning / shape targeting (the primary soft-body-specific mechanism, distinct from cloth's
vertex-group pinning): `use_goal`, `goal_default`, `goal_min`, `goal_max`, `goal_spring`,
`goal_friction`, `vertex_group_goal` — each vertex is pulled toward its **animated/rest** position
by a goal spring rather than being rigidly locked, so goal-pinned soft bodies can still jiggle
around their target.

Edge-spring model (`use_edges` must be on to use mesh edges as springs at all): `pull`, `push`,
`damping`, `bend`, `shear`, `plastic` (permanent/plastic deformation, 0–100), `spring_length`
(% shrink/grow of rest length), `vertex_group_spring`.

Self/edge/face collision (soft body's own, cheaper, "ball" model — distinct from the Cloth
collision system): `use_self_collision`, `use_edge_collision`, `use_face_collision`,
`ball_size`, `ball_stiff`, `ball_damp`, `collision_type` enum
(`MANUAL`/`AVERAGE`/`MINIMAL`/`MAXIMAL`/`MINMAX` — ways to auto-derive `ball_size` from spring
length), `fuzzy` (collision fuzziness — higher is faster but less stable), `collision_collection`.

Solver quality/cost knobs: `step_min`, `step_max`, `use_auto_step`, `error_threshold` (Runge-Kutta
ODE solver tolerance — lower = more precise/slower), `use_diagnose`.

Aerodynamics (cloth-like "sail" behavior applied to edges rather than faces): `aero`,
`aerodynamics_type` (`SIMPLE` / `LIFT_FORCE`).

Mass/gravity/friction: `mass`, `friction`, `gravity` (float, **not** a vector — see below),
`vertex_group_mass`, `speed`.

**Gotcha, empirically confirmed**: the bare RNA schema defaults documented for several of these
fields are *not* what you actually get after `modifier_add(type='SOFT_BODY')`. Reading the settings
right after adding the modifier (live-confirmed):

| Field | RNA doc "default" | Actual value right after `modifier_add` |
|---|---|---|
| `gravity` | 0.0 | **9.8** |
| `mass` | 0.0 | **1.0** |
| `use_goal` | False | **True** |
| `use_edges` | False | **True** |

The add-operator's C-side initializer sets practical starting values that differ from the RNA
property's bare declared default. **Always read settings back after `modifier_add()`** rather than
assuming the documented default is what you'll actually simulate with.

### When soft body beats cloth (community/manual guidance — not independently benchmarked here)

Soft body operates on the object's general edge/volume topology (springs + optional goal/volume
preservation), so it suits **volumetric, blobby, gelatinous** deformation — jelly, simple
squishy props, rope-like edge chains — where the whole solid volume should wobble, not just a thin
sheet. Cloth is purpose-built for **2-manifold sheet** behavior (its stiffness model decomposes
into tension/compression/shear/bending specifically because that maps onto a fabric surface) and
has a more robust, actively-maintained self-collision system. Community consensus (Blender manual,
tutorials) treats soft body as the older, cheaper-but-less-stable option and generally recommends
Cloth for anything that visually reads as fabric, reserving Soft Body for squishy/gelatinous solids
where Cloth's sheet assumptions don't fit. I did not independently benchmark performance/stability
between the two in this pass — this is cited as documented community guidance, not a measured result.

---

## Particles

### Minimal setup — empirically verified working headlessly

```python
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = emitter_obj
bpy.ops.object.particle_system_add()          # -> {'FINISHED'}, zero context override needed
psys = emitter_obj.particle_systems[0]
settings = psys.settings                       # ParticleSettings — a reusable ID datablock (bpy.data.particles)
```

Confirmed: no selection or extra context required beyond an active object, matching the pattern
seen for rigid body/cloth/soft-body `modifier_add`/`object_add` calls.

### Key fields for debris/sparks/leaves-style use (bundled `api/bpy.types.ParticleSettings.rst`)

- `type`: `EMITTER` (default) or `HAIR`.
- `physics_type`: `NO`, `NEWTON` (default — simple ballistic point-mass physics, gravity + drag +
  effectors), `KEYED`, `BOIDS`, `FLUID`.
- `emit_from`: `VERT`, `FACE` (default), `VOLUME`.
- `count`, `frame_start`, `frame_end` (the **emission window**, independent of the particles'
  individual `lifetime`/`lifetime_random`).
- `integrator`: `EULER`, `VERLET`, `MIDPOINT` (default), `RK4` — speed vs. stability/accuracy;
  matters for fast-moving debris/sparks where cheap Euler integration can visibly diverge.
- `damping`, `effector_weights` (force-field response — wind/turbulence for e.g. sparks drifting).
- `factor_random` (initial-velocity randomization), `angular_velocity_mode` +
  `angular_velocity_factor` (tumbling debris), `size_random`, `rotation_factor_random`.

### Rendering as objects/collections — the actual "render instance" mechanism, verified

```python
settings.render_type = 'COLLECTION'            # NONE / HALO / LINE / PATH / OBJECT / COLLECTION
settings.instance_collection = debris_collection    # rotate through a Collection's members per particle
# or: settings.instance_object = single_debris_obj   # one object for every particle
```

Empirically verified: assigning a `Collection` to `instance_collection` with `render_type =
'COLLECTION'` round-trips correctly (`settings.instance_collection.name` reads back as assigned).
Related toggles that shape how collection members get distributed: `use_whole_collection`,
`use_collection_pick_random`, `use_collection_count`; and whether each instanced object's own
transform is honored: `use_rotation_instance`, `use_scale_instance`, `use_global_instance`.

**Moving a freshly-created object into a specific collection (a small but real gotcha
encountered while testing this)**: a plain `collection.objects.link(obj)` right after
`primitive_*_add()` can raise `RuntimeError: Object 'X' not in collection 'Scene Collection'`
if you assume which collection the object landed in and try to `unlink` from the wrong one. The
robust pattern is to unlink from **every** collection the object is actually in, then link it to
the target:

```python
for c in list(obj.users_collection):
    c.objects.unlink(obj)
debris_collection.objects.link(obj)
```

### Baking

Particle systems share the exact same `PointCache` API as rigid body/cloth/soft body
(`psys.point_cache`, confirmed via `PointCache`'s own "References" list in the bundled docs
explicitly naming `ParticleSystem.point_cache`). The same verified `ptcache.bake` context-override
pattern from **Caching & baking** applies unchanged:

```python
with bpy.context.temp_override(point_cache=psys.point_cache):
    bpy.ops.ptcache.bake(bake=True)
```

I did not independently re-run this specific call against a live particle system in this pass
(time budget) — it is included here on the strength of `PointCache` being the identical shared
type verified working for rigid body, not as a separately-executed test. The same
`scene.frame_set()` manual-stepping alternative (verified for rigid body and cloth) should apply
identically here for the same structural reason.

### Practical note: particles vs. individual rigid bodies for debris (community pattern)

For **foreground/hero** debris that needs to convincingly collide, tumble, and settle against the
environment, the more robust and commonly-used professional pattern is to give each chunk its own
real rigid body (with an initial velocity via the kinematic-handoff trick — see **Hybrid
keyframe+physics**) rather than driving it through the particle system, because `NEWTON`-physics
particles get simplified point-mass collision against `.collision`-enabled deflector objects, not
full rigid-body rotation/collision response, and particle instances don't collide with each other.
Particles are the right tool for **background/volume** debris — many small bits where individual
collision fidelity doesn't matter (dust, sparks, falling leaves at a distance). This is a
documented community pattern, not independently benchmarked here.
## Export/handoff of sims

### The single biggest surprise this pass turned up: Blender 4.4+/5.x changed how F-curves are read back

Before covering export formats: any code that **inspects** baked keyframes (to verify a bake, or to
prepare data for export) needs to know this. Blender 4.4 introduced **layered/slotted Actions**;
Blender 5.0 then **removed** the backward-compatible shim. Empirically confirmed on the connected
5.1.1:

```python
>>> cube.animation_data.action.fcurves
AttributeError: 'Action' object has no attribute 'fcurves'
```

`bpy.types.Action` in 5.1.1 (bundled `api/bpy.types.Action.rst`, confirmed live) has **no**
`.fcurves`/`.groups` at all — only `.layers` (`ActionLayers[ActionLayer]`) and `.slots`
(`ActionSlots[ActionSlot]`). The real chain, confirmed via the bundled `ActionLayer`,
`ActionKeyframeStrip`, `ActionSlot`, `AnimData` docs (`ActionKeyframeStrip.channelbag(slot,
ensure=False) -> ActionChannelbag`, `ActionChannelbag.fcurves`):

```python
action = obj.animation_data.action
slot = obj.animation_data.action_slot
for layer in action.layers:
    for strip in layer.strips:
        channelbag = strip.channelbag(slot)     # None if this slot has no data on this strip
        if channelbag:
            for fc in channelbag.fcurves:
                ...
```

Or use Blender's own convenience helpers (confirmed present in bundled
`bpy_extras.anim_utils.rst`, and matching a Blender Artists thread's recommended pattern —
[How to access fcurves in Blender 5.0](https://blenderartists.org/t/how-to-access-fcurves-in-blender-5-0/1623022)):

```python
from bpy_extras import anim_utils
channelbag = anim_utils.action_get_channelbag_for_slot(action, slot)      # read, may be None
channelbag = anim_utils.action_ensure_channelbag_for_slot(action, slot)   # get-or-create
```

**Exact version boundary** (via search-tool corroboration of Blender's own release notes,
`developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.4/upgrading/slotted_actions/` and
`.../5.0/python_api/` — direct fetch of both pages was blocked with HTTP 403, so this is
search-tool-mediated, not a verbatim page read):

- **4.3 and earlier**: flat `action.fcurves`/`action.groups`/`action.id_root` — this is what
  most existing tutorials and scripts assume.
- **4.4**: introduced layers/slots/channelbags, but **kept** `action.fcurves`/`action.groups` as a
  documented "backward-compatible legacy API" operating on the first slot only (auto-creating a
  "Legacy Slot" the first time something writes through it).
- **5.0+**: the legacy shim was **removed**. `action.fcurves`/`action.groups`/`action.id_root` no
  longer exist at all; `action.id_root` became `action_slot.target_id_type`. Empirically confirmed
  on 5.1.1.

Since this skill's baseline is 4.3 and the other installed version is 5.1, **any code that reads
back baked animation must go through the channelbag/`anim_utils` path to work on 5.x, while still
working on 4.3** (where `action.layers`/`.slots` do not exist at all pre-4.4, so the channelbag
path is 4.4+-only). A defensive helper that works on both sides of the 4.4 boundary:

```python
def get_fcurves(obj):
    ad = obj.animation_data
    if ad is None or ad.action is None:
        return []
    action = ad.action
    if hasattr(action, "fcurves"):                 # 4.3 and earlier (flat model)
        return list(action.fcurves)
    from bpy_extras import anim_utils               # 4.4+ (layered model)
    slot = ad.action_slot
    cb = anim_utils.action_get_channelbag_for_slot(action, slot) if slot else None
    return list(cb.fcurves) if cb else []
```

### `bake_to_keyframes` output — what channels it produces

Since `bake_to_keyframes` itself is confirmed broken headlessly (see **Caching & baking**), this
was verified via the equivalent robust path (`anim_utils.bake_action`, `do_location=True,
do_rotation=True, do_scale=False`), which produces the same kind of output the native operator is
documented to produce. Confirmed result: F-curves on exactly `location` (3 channels) and
`rotation_euler` (3 channels, or `rotation_quaternion` if the object's `rotation_mode` is
quaternion-based — not itself separately tested, inferred from `keyframe_insert`'s standard
behavior of keying whatever the object's actual current rotation representation is).

### FBX export and physics sims — precisely, what does and does not survive

`bpy.ops.export_scene.fbx(...)` full signature captured live (bundled `api/bpy.ops.export_scene.rst`,
`addons_core/io_scene_fbx/__init__.py:604`). The relevant parameters for this question:

- `use_mesh_modifiers=True` (default): applies the modifier stack (including Cloth/Soft Body) to
  each mesh **at whatever frame is current at export time** — a single static snapshot. There is
  no parameter anywhere in this operator's signature that re-evaluates modifiers per exported frame
  for mesh *vertex* data.
- The operator's own doc string for `use_mesh_modifiers` explicitly warns: **"WARNING: prevents
  exporting shape keys"** — i.e. applying the modifier stack and exporting shape-key (blend shape)
  animation are **mutually exclusive** in this exporter.
- `bake_anim`, `bake_anim_use_all_bones`, `bake_anim_use_nla_strips`, `bake_anim_use_all_actions`,
  `bake_anim_force_startend_keying`, `bake_anim_step`, `bake_anim_simplify_factor` are **all**
  about baking **armature/bone Action/NLA-driven** animation into the FBX. None of them touch
  modifier-stack or per-vertex mesh deformation.

**Conclusion, precisely** (this is what research question 7 asked to verify): a Cloth or Soft Body
simulation's per-frame vertex deformation **does not survive FBX export as playable animation**.
FBX only carries (a) object-transform keyframes (fine for rigid-body debris baked via
`bake_action`/manual `keyframe_insert`) and (b) armature-bone animation plus hand-authored
shape-key/blend-shape animation — and neither of those is what a live modifier deformation
automatically becomes. To get cloth motion into an FBX-consuming pipeline you would have to
manually convert the simulation into a keyframed shape-key sequence yourself; Blender has no
single built-in operator that does this conversion (see next paragraph), so it's a genuinely manual,
non-trivial DIY step, not a checkbox.

**DIY shape-key bake, `[DESIGN]` — not run to completion in this pass**, built only from
independently-verified primitives (evaluated-mesh reading confirmed under Cloth above; `keyframe_insert`
confirmed under Caching & baking):

```python
for f in range(frame_start, frame_end + 1):
    scene.frame_set(f)
    depsgraph = bpy.context.evaluated_depsgraph_get()
    obj_eval = obj.evaluated_get(depsgraph)
    mesh_eval = obj_eval.to_mesh()
    sk = obj.shape_key_add(name=f"frame_{f}", from_mix=False)
    for i, v in enumerate(mesh_eval.vertices):
        sk.data[i].co = v.co
    obj_eval.to_mesh_clear()
    # then keyframe sk.value as a 0/1/0 spike at frame f — one shape key PER FRAME,
    # which is heavy (hundreds of shape keys for a long sim) and not how this is normally done in practice.
```

Given the cost of one-shape-key-per-frame, Alembic (below) is the practical answer whenever the
target pipeline can consume it.

### Alembic export — confirmed working, correctly captures per-vertex deformation

```python
bpy.ops.wm.alembic_export(filepath=path, start=1, end=20, selected=True)
```

**Empirically verified**: this wrote a real 335,838-byte `.abc` file starting with the `Ogawa`
magic header bytes (`b'Ogawa\xff\x00...'` — Alembic's standard binary storage backend), exporting
the same cloth plane whose per-vertex deformation was independently confirmed varying frame-to-
frame (see **Cloth**). The exporter's own `start`/`end` parameters drive its **internal** per-frame
re-evaluation during export, independent of whatever frame the scene happened to be on when the
operator was called.

**Methodological note on this specific finding**: `bpy.ops.wm.alembic_export` is **absent** from
this MCP server's bundled/offline doc index — both `get_python_api_docs("bpy.ops.wm.alembic_export")`
and a full-text `search_api_docs` for "alembic export" returned nothing, and enumerating
`dir(bpy.ops.wm)` via the bundled `bpy.ops.wm` namespace listing also did not include it. A
plain WebSearch summary hedged uncertainly on whether it still existed. Only **live introspection
against the actual running Blender 5.1.1** (`hasattr(bpy.ops.wm, 'alembic_export')` →
`True`, then a real successful export call) settled this. This is a direct, concrete illustration
of the cite-then-verify discipline this brief demanded — the offline doc index for this specific
operator was stale/incomplete, and only executing against the live process caught it.

Full parameter list captured live via the operator's own RNA (`bpy.ops.wm.alembic_export.get_rna_type().properties`,
via the collection-exporter's `export_properties`): `filepath`, `start`, `end`, `selected`,
`visible_objects_only` is **not** present in 5.1.1 (see version note below), `global_scale`,
`flatten`, `uvs`, `vcolors`, `normals`, `face_sets`, `subdiv_schema`, `apply_subdiv`,
`curves_as_mesh`, `export_hair`, `export_particles`, `export_custom_properties`,
`use_instancing`, `triangulate`, `quad_method`, `ngon_method`, `packuv`, `orcos`, `gsamples`
(motion-blur shutter samples), `sh_open`/`sh_close` (shutter open/close), `sort_method`,
`init_scene_frame_range`, `evaluation_mode`, `as_background_job`, `display_type`,
`check_existing`, `filemode`, plus standard file-browser filter fields.

**Version note (Blender 4.2+ collection exporters)**: 5.1 also exposes Alembic (and USD) export
through a newer "Collection Exporters" system — confirmed live:

```python
exporter = collection.exporters.new('IO_FH_alembic', name="AlembicExporter")
bpy.ops.wm.collection_export_all()          # -> {'FINISHED'}, exports every collection's attached exporters
```

Per search-tool-sourced release notes, the `visible_objects_only` option was removed from
`wm.alembic_export`/`wm.usd_export` in Blender 5.0. For a one-shot script/MCP export, calling
`bpy.ops.wm.alembic_export()` directly (as verified above) is simpler than setting up a collection
exporter and works the same way on 4.3 and 5.x; collection exporters are more suited to an
artist-maintained "always export this collection on save" workflow.

### MDD / PC2 point-cache export — not available in this Blender build

Checked directly: `bpy.ops.export_shape` does not exist as a module at all
(`get_python_api_docs` returns `found: false` with an **empty** available-members list), and
`bpy.ops.export_anim` only contains `bvh` (BVH motion-capture export for armatures — unrelated to
mesh vertex caches). Blender historically bundled a Lightwave Point Cache (`.mdd`)/`.pc2` exporter
add-on; it is **not present** in this 5.1.1 build. If a downstream pipeline specifically needs
MDD/PC2 rather than Alembic, that requires a third-party/legacy add-on — out of scope for a
programmatic, current-Blender skill. Don't assume this exporter exists; verify per-installation if
it matters.
## Determinism & scale gotchas

### Gravity is not one single setting

`scene.gravity` is a `Vector`, live-confirmed default `(0.0, 0.0, -9.81)` — this drives rigid body
simulation. But **Cloth and Soft Body each carry their own independent gravity override**:
`ClothSettings.gravity` (Vector, confirmed default `(0, 0, -9.81)`, matching the scene) and
`SoftBodySettings.gravity` (a **float**, not a vector — confirmed the add-operator actually
initializes it to `9.8`, not the RNA schema's stated `0.0` default, per the **Soft body** section
above). Changing `scene.gravity` alone will **not** change already-configured cloth/soft-body sims
— all three need to be set for consistency if that matters for the shot.

### The classic "scene scale" slow-motion bug (documented, not independently reproduced visually here)

Blender's physics assumes **1 Blender unit = 1 real-world meter** — gravity is a fixed
`9.81` units/s² constant (confirmed above), and `rigidbody.mass_calculate`'s density presets are
real-world kg/m³ values (confirmed via the live ~45-item material enum: `Air`, `Steel`, `Gold`,
etc.). If a scene/asset was authored or imported at the wrong real-world scale (e.g., 1 Blender
unit representing 1 cm instead of 1 m, so a visually "human-sized" object is actually 100× too
small in Blender units), gravity will look wrong **relative to the object's own size**: an
object too small in Blender units falls the same fixed number of *units*/s² as anything else, so
relative to its own tiny extent it visibly crawls — this reads as slow-motion/moon-gravity. An
object modeled too *large* looks unnaturally fast/violent by the same logic. Fix: match Scene
Properties → Units → Unit Scale to the asset's real dimensions (1.0 = meters), or literally rescale
geometry so 1 Blender unit ≈ 1 meter before simulating. I did not stage a dedicated "shrink the
whole scene 100× and watch it look wrong" visual repro in this pass — the mechanism (a fixed,
unit-independent gravity constant, confirmed above) is verified; this specific visual symptom is
cited as standard/manual-level community knowledge, not independently re-demonstrated here.

### Per-object un-applied `object.scale` — tested, and the answer is more nuanced than blanket folklore

Ran a controlled A/B comparison (isolated, single-purpose Blender processes each — see the cache-
invalidation note in **Caching & baking** for why isolation mattered) on a default cube (base
half-extent 1) given a non-uniform `scale = (1, 1, 3)`, **not** applied, positioned so its scaled
bottom face exactly touches a passive floor at `z = 0`:

| Collision shape | Un-applied scale, final resting Z (should be 3.0) | Applied scale, final resting Z |
|---|---|---|
| `BOX` | **3.0000** (exact, every frame) | 3.0000 |
| `CONVEX_HULL` | **2.9202** (~0.08 unit / ~2.7% penetration into the floor) | 3.0001 (essentially exact) |

`mass_calculate(material='Custom', density=1.0)` gave **24.0 in every combination** (matching the
true world-space volume 2×2×6=24), confirming mass calculation correctly accounts for world-space
scale regardless of whether it's applied.

**Conclusion, evidence-based rather than folklore-repeated**: for a simple analytic `BOX` shape
with no rotation, un-applied non-uniform scale made **no measurable difference** to either mass or
collision response. For `CONVEX_HULL` (mesh-derived) collision, un-applied scale produced a real,
small, consistently reproducible penetration. The likely mechanism (not independently isolated
further) is that Blender's small fixed collision margin around hull-type shapes doesn't scale
consistently with an un-applied object transform. **Practical recommendation**: apply scale
(`bpy.ops.object.transform_apply(location=False, rotation=False, scale=True)` — standard operator,
requires the object selected+active, confirmed working headlessly) before adding physics whenever
using `MESH`/`CONVEX_HULL`/`COMPOUND` shapes. It is not proven necessary for `BOX`/`SPHERE` on an
unrotated object by this test, but community sources (not independently re-tested here) additionally
flag non-uniform-scale-combined-**with**-rotation, rigid body constraints, and cloth/soft-body
(whose spring rest-lengths are derived from **local**-space edge lengths, so an un-applied scale
makes the stiffness sliders behave inconsistently with the sheet's real-world size) as further
reasons to apply scale as a standing habit — applying it is zero-cost, so there's little reason not
to as a default.

### A related, smaller gotcha caught while building the scale test: stale `.dimensions` reads

Reading `obj.dimensions` **immediately** after directly setting `obj.scale = (...)` via the data API,
with no operator call and no explicit depsgraph update in between, returned the **pre-change**
bounding-box size in testing (a `(1,1,3)`-scaled 2×2×2 cube reported `dimensions = (2,2,2)`, not
`(2,2,6)`, until something else forced an update). After `transform_apply` (a full operator call)
ran, dimensions were correct immediately. This suggests `.dimensions` (and other
`matrix_world`-derived read-back properties) can be **stale** immediately after a raw data-API
transform write, until the depsgraph next refreshes — don't trust a `.dimensions`/`.matrix_world`
read placed directly after a bare property assignment without an intervening `frame_set()`,
operator call, or explicit depsgraph update.

### FPS vs. substeps

`rigidbody_world.substeps_per_frame` (confirmed live, see **Rigid body**) is named and documented
as "steps taken **per frame**", not per second — so it scales with whatever the scene's frame rate
is, not against a fixed real-time rate. Raising `substeps_per_frame`/`solver_iterations` improves
accuracy for fast-moving/thin objects (reduces tunneling) at CPU cost, independent of playback FPS.
Changing `scene.render.fps` without adjusting frame-relative parameters (particle `lifetime`,
keyframed timing, `frame_start`/`frame_end` of a cache) will change how much *wall-clock* time a
fixed frame range represents, which in turn changes how "fast" the simulated motion reads, even
though the physics stepping itself is unaffected. I did not independently re-verify `scene.render.fps`'s
exact property path via the bundled docs in this pass (the relevant RST file exceeded the bundle's
inline-size threshold and the search index returned no hits for it) — it is an extremely stable,
long-standing Blender API and is included here on that basis rather than a fresh citation.

### Origin placement (center of mass) for rigid bodies

`RigidBodyObject` has no separate "center of mass override" property (confirmed absent from its
live-enumerated field list) — the effective center of mass for a primitive collision shape follows
the object's **origin**. `bpy.ops.object.origin_set(type=..., center='MEDIAN'|'BOUNDS')` is the
relevant operator (doc confirmed: `type` enum is `GEOMETRY_ORIGIN`, `ORIGIN_GEOMETRY`,
`ORIGIN_CURSOR`, `ORIGIN_CENTER_OF_MASS`, `ORIGIN_CENTER_OF_VOLUME`). Note the **precise documented
distinction** between the two mass-related options, easy to conflate: `ORIGIN_CENTER_OF_MASS` is
computed **"from the surface area"** (i.e. treats the object like a hollow shell), while
`ORIGIN_CENTER_OF_VOLUME` is computed **"from the volume (must be manifold geometry with
consistent normals)"**. For a solid prop with uniform assumed density, `ORIGIN_CENTER_OF_VOLUME` is
the physically-meaningful choice, not `ORIGIN_CENTER_OF_MASS` despite the more inviting name —
this was verified from the operator's own doc string, not assumed.

## Hybrid keyframe+physics

### Throwing an object with initial velocity — the kinematic-handoff trick, verified end to end

Since `RigidBodyObject` has no settable velocity property at all (confirmed under **Rigid body**),
the only way to give a rigid body motion at the moment it starts simulating is to animate it
normally while `kinematic = True`, then switch `kinematic` to `False` (keyframed) at the release
frame. `kinematic` is a plain bool property and is keyframeable like any other:

```python
cube.rigid_body.kinematic = True
cube.rigid_body.keyframe_insert(data_path="kinematic", frame=1)
for f in range(1, 11):                       # phase 1: fully keyframed motion, +X at 1 unit/frame
    cube.location = (1.0 * (f - 1), 0.0, 10.0)
    cube.keyframe_insert(data_path="location", frame=f)

cube.rigid_body.kinematic = False            # phase 2: hand off to the dynamic simulation
cube.rigid_body.keyframe_insert(data_path="kinematic", frame=11)
```

**Empirically verified, exact numbers**: stepping frames 1→30, X advanced exactly 0,1,2,...,9
during the keyframed phase (frames 1–10) as expected. At frame 11 (the instant `kinematic` becomes
`False`), the object's X position **continued advancing** (9.999 → 10.996 → 11.992 → 12.986 → ...),
at very nearly the same ~1 unit/frame rate established during the keyframed phase, while Z
simultaneously began falling under gravity (10.0 → 9.99 → 9.96 → ... → 6.6 by frame 30). This
conclusively confirms **Blender's rigid body system inherits velocity from the object's keyframed
motion at the exact frame the handoff happens** — it does not reset to rest. The gradual slight
decrease in the per-frame X delta after release (0.9973, 0.9957, 0.994, 0.9923, ...) is consistent
with `RigidBodyObject.linear_damping`'s default non-zero value continuously bleeding off velocity
once the object is dynamic — not a flaw in the handoff itself.

**Practical pattern derived from this test** (the specific "≥2 prior keyframes" requirement was
not separately isolated — this reflects what was actually tested, not a proven minimum): keyframe
at least a couple of frames of real motion immediately before the release frame so Blender has a
genuine position delta to compute a velocity from, then keyframe `kinematic = False` exactly on the
frame you want the throw to begin. A single static keyframe with no preceding motion would give
Blender nothing to compute a velocity from and was not tested here.
## Pitfalls

Consolidated, ranked roughly by how much damage each would do to a skill author who didn't know
about it. All numbered items were empirically verified in this pass unless explicitly marked
"community/manual-sourced."

1. **`Action.fcurves` does not exist in Blender 5.0+.** The single biggest 4.3-vs-5.x breaking
   change relevant to this entire skill domain — it silently breaks *any* code that inspects or
   post-processes baked keyframes (which is most of what a physics-baking skill needs to do after
   simulating). 4.3: flat `action.fcurves` works. 4.4: still works (legacy shim). 5.0+: `AttributeError`.
   Use `bpy_extras.anim_utils.action_get_channelbag_for_slot()`/`action_ensure_channelbag_for_slot()`,
   or branch on `hasattr(action, "fcurves")`. See **Export/handoff of sims**.

2. **`rigidbody.bake_to_keyframes` fails in headless/background execution**, and the failure
   traces to a real, tracked Blender architecture limitation (context overrides on an outer
   Python-defined operator do not propagate into `bpy.ops.*` calls that operator makes internally
   — corroborated by bug reports `T63067`/`T97382`), not a mistake in how it's called. No
   `temp_override` combination rescued it, including one supplying a real window/screen/area/region.
   Default to `bpy_extras.anim_utils.bake_action()` or a manual per-frame `keyframe_insert()` loop —
   both are pure data-API and verified working in every context tested. Whether the native operator
   happens to work when driven by a live GUI Blender via the MCP bridge (this skill's actual target)
   was **not** verified — no live GUI instance was reachable during this research pass — so treat it
   as unverified-good / confirmed-bad rather than "always works in the real target."

3. **`ptcache.bake(bake=True)` needs `bpy.context.temp_override(point_cache=world.point_cache)`** or
   it raises `RuntimeError: ... poll() failed, context is incorrect`. Verified minimal working fix.

4. **`rigidbody_world.steps_per_second` was renamed `substeps_per_frame`.** Confirmed absent/present
   exactly this way on the connected 5.1.1. Use a `getattr` fallback for cross-version code; I could
   not pin the exact version boundary (no 4.3 executable was available to diff against directly).

5. **`bpy.ops.wm.alembic_export` is missing from this MCP server's own offline/bundled doc index**,
   even though it demonstrably exists and works on the live connected Blender. A pure documentation-
   only verification pass would have concluded (wrongly) that Alembic export was removed. Only live
   execution against the actual process caught this — the concrete illustration, inside this very
   research task, of why "cite the bundled doc snippet" is a hint and live/primary verification is
   what actually settles a claim.

6. **FBX cannot carry Cloth/Soft-Body per-frame vertex deformation.** `use_mesh_modifiers=True`
   bakes a single static snapshot at the current frame and its own doc string says it **prevents**
   shape-key export; none of the `bake_anim_*` parameters touch modifier/vertex data, only
   armature/Action/NLA animation. Alembic (verified working, captures true per-frame deformation) or
   a manual per-frame shape-key bake (not built-in, `[DESIGN]` only) are the only paths.

7. **Directly setting `.scale`/`.location`/`.rotation_euler` via the data API can leave
   `.dimensions` (and likely other `matrix_world`-derived reads) stale** until the next depsgraph
   update/operator call/`frame_set()`. Don't read derived geometry immediately after a bare
   transform write inside the same script tick without something forcing a refresh in between.

8. **Un-applied non-uniform object scale is not a blanket physics bug** — measured **zero**
   difference for `BOX` shape (mass and resting position identical to 4 decimals with/without
   `transform_apply`), but a real, small, reproducible ~2.7%-of-half-height penetration for
   `CONVEX_HULL`. Apply scale as a standing habit for mesh/hull-derived collision shapes; it's not
   proven necessary for simple analytic shapes on an unrotated object, but costs nothing to do
   anyway.

9. **Point cache can go stale when rigid-body-world collection membership changes after a bake/step
   already ran for that range.** Empirically caught as an A/B discrepancy (identical setup gave a
   correct rest position in an isolated fresh process, but fell straight through the floor when run
   as one of several sequential rigid-body experiments sharing the same scene/world). Free/rebuild
   the point cache (or just use a fresh scene/world) whenever the set of simulated objects changes
   after any prior baking/stepping in that same world.

10. **Cloth/Soft-Body preset scripts assume a `context.cloth`/`context.soft_body` context member**
    (`bpy.context.cloth.settings.X = value`), the same fragile pattern as `ptcache.bake`'s
    `point_cache` member. Don't invoke Blender's preset-execute operator from a headless script —
    set the numeric fields directly on `modifiers["Cloth"].settings` (exact preset values are listed
    in **Cloth**, read verbatim from Blender's own installed preset files).

11. **`rigidbody.mass_calculate`'s `material` parameter is not `'DEFAULT'`** despite the operator's
    own bundled doc string literally saying `Literal['DEFAULT']`. The real, live enum is a ~45-item
    named-material list ending in `'Custom'`. Use `'Custom'` with an explicit `density` for a
    precise, script-controlled mass; calling with `material='DEFAULT'` raises `TypeError`.

12. **No built-in MDD/PC2 exporter exists in this Blender build** (`bpy.ops.export_shape` module
    doesn't exist at all; `bpy.ops.export_anim` only has `bvh`). Don't assume it's available;
    verify per-installation if a specific pipeline needs that format instead of Alembic.

13. **`RigidBodyObject.mesh_source` (`BASE`/`DEFORM`/`FINAL`) matters whenever a rigid body object
    also carries a deforming modifier** (e.g. Cloth or Armature on the same object) — `DEFORM`/
    `FINAL` track that deformation every frame (more expensive), `BASE` stays static from the
    undeformed mesh. Easy to overlook since most rigid bodies are simple rigid props where this
    never comes up.

14. **`SoftBodySettings`' actual initialized values differ from the bare RNA-documented defaults**
    right after `modifier_add(type='SOFT_BODY')` (`gravity` reads 9.8 not the doc's stated 0.0,
    `mass` reads 1.0 not 0.0, `use_goal`/`use_edges` read `True` not `False`). Always read settings
    back after adding the modifier rather than trusting the bare property doc string for "what will
    this look like out of the box."

15. **Direct `WebFetch` to both `developer.blender.org` and `docs.blender.org` returned HTTP 403**
    throughout this research pass — a methodological limitation for whoever extends this research
    later. The bundled MCP-server doc mirror plus the web-search tool's own fetch capability were
    the only ways to reach that content in this sandbox; a future pass with working direct fetch
    access to those domains could tighten the citations that are currently search-tool-mediated.
## Verified bpy snippets

Every snippet in this section was actually executed against Blender 5.1.1 in `--background` mode
during this research pass (not written from memory). Doc citations point to the bundled RST mirror
of `docs.blender.org/api/` (identifier given; construct the URL as
`https://docs.blender.org/api/<version>/<identifier>.html`).

### 1. Rigid body basics — active + passive, zero context override needed

```python
import bpy
scene = bpy.context.scene

bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_plane_add(size=10, location=(0, 0, 0))
floor = bpy.context.active_object
bpy.ops.rigidbody.object_add(type='PASSIVE')          # bpy.ops.rigidbody.object_add

bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(location=(0, 0, 5))
cube = bpy.context.active_object
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = cube
bpy.ops.rigidbody.object_add(type='ACTIVE')
cube.rigid_body.collision_shape = 'BOX'               # bpy.types.RigidBodyObject.collision_shape
cube.rigid_body.mass = 1.0
cube.rigid_body.friction = 0.5
cube.rigid_body.restitution = 0.3                     # "bounciness"
```
Doc: `bpy.ops.rigidbody.object_add`, `bpy.types.RigidBodyObject`.

### 2. Rigid body constraint (hinge) between two bodies

```python
bpy.ops.object.empty_add(location=(1, 0, 5))
con_obj = bpy.context.active_object
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = con_obj
bpy.ops.rigidbody.constraint_add(type='HINGE')        # bpy.ops.rigidbody.constraint_add
con = con_obj.rigid_body_constraint
con.object1 = obj_a
con.object2 = obj_b
con.use_breaking = True
con.breaking_threshold = 50.0
```
Doc: `bpy.ops.rigidbody.constraint_add`, `bpy.types.RigidBodyConstraint`.

### 3. Simulating via plain frame-stepping (no bake needed) — rigid body or cloth

```python
scene.frame_start, scene.frame_end = 1, 60
for f in range(scene.frame_start, scene.frame_end + 1):
    scene.frame_set(f)                                # bpy.types.Scene.frame_set (drives the sim)
    # scene.rigidbody_world.point_cache.is_baked becomes True once the full range has been stepped
```

### 4. `ptcache.bake` from script — the verified working context override

```python
rbw = scene.rigidbody_world
with bpy.context.temp_override(point_cache=rbw.point_cache):
    bpy.ops.ptcache.bake(bake=True)                   # bpy.ops.ptcache.bake — FAILS without this override
```

### 5. Robust bake-to-keyframes (works everywhere; native `rigidbody.bake_to_keyframes` does not)

```python
from bpy_extras import anim_utils
action = anim_utils.bake_action(                       # bpy_extras.anim_utils.bake_action
    cube, action=None, frames=range(1, 61),
    bake_options=anim_utils.BakeOptions(
        only_selected=False, do_pose=False, do_object=True, do_visual_keying=True,
        do_constraint_clear=False, do_parents_clear=False, do_clean=False,
        do_location=True, do_rotation=True, do_scale=False, do_bbone=False, do_custom_props=False,
    ),
)
```

Or the dependency-free manual version:

```python
for f in range(1, 61):
    scene.frame_set(f)
    cube.keyframe_insert(data_path="location", frame=f)      # bpy_struct.keyframe_insert — no operator, no poll
    cube.keyframe_insert(data_path="rotation_euler", frame=f)
```

### 6. Reading back F-curves safely across the Blender 4.3 / 4.4+ / 5.0+ Action-model split

```python
def get_fcurves(obj):
    ad = obj.animation_data
    if ad is None or ad.action is None:
        return []
    action = ad.action
    if hasattr(action, "fcurves"):            # Blender <= 4.x (4.4 kept it as a legacy shim)
        return list(action.fcurves)
    from bpy_extras import anim_utils          # Blender 5.0+ — legacy shim removed
    slot = ad.action_slot
    cb = anim_utils.action_get_channelbag_for_slot(action, slot) if slot else None
    return list(cb.fcurves) if cb else []
```
Doc: `bpy.types.Action`, `bpy.types.ActionChannelbag`, `bpy_extras.anim_utils`.

### 7. Cloth: modifier, cotton-like settings, pin group, collision floor

```python
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = cloth_plane
bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='CLOTH')             # bpy.ops.object.modifier_add
cs = cloth_plane.modifiers["Cloth"].settings           # bpy.types.ClothSettings
cs.quality = 5; cs.mass = 0.3
cs.tension_stiffness = cs.compression_stiffness = cs.shear_stiffness = 15
cs.bending_stiffness = 0.5
cs.tension_damping = cs.compression_damping = cs.shear_damping = 5
cs.air_damping = 1.0

vg = cloth_plane.vertex_groups.new(name="Pin")         # bpy.types.VertexGroup.add
vg.add([0, 1, 2, 3], 1.0, 'REPLACE')
cs.vertex_group_mass = vg.name

cloth_plane.modifiers["Cloth"].collision_settings.use_collision = True
cloth_plane.modifiers["Cloth"].collision_settings.distance_min = 0.015

bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = floor
bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='COLLISION')          # collider side: object.collision, NOT a modifier sub-struct
floor.collision.thickness_outer = 0.02
```

### 8. Reading deformed cloth/soft-body geometry per frame (no baking required)

```python
for f in range(1, 21):
    scene.frame_set(f)
    depsgraph = bpy.context.evaluated_depsgraph_get()
    obj_eval = cloth_plane.evaluated_get(depsgraph)
    mesh_eval = obj_eval.to_mesh()
    verts_world = [obj_eval.matrix_world @ v.co for v in mesh_eval.vertices]
    obj_eval.to_mesh_clear()
```

### 9. Soft body minimal setup

```python
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = blob
bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='SOFT_BODY')          # modifier is named "Softbody" (no space)
sb = blob.modifiers["Softbody"].settings               # bpy.types.SoftBodySettings
sb.use_goal = True
sb.goal_spring = 0.5
sb.use_edges = True
sb.pull = 0.5; sb.push = 0.5; sb.damping = 5.0
```

### 10. Particle debris using a collection of instanced objects

```python
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = emitter
bpy.ops.object.particle_system_add()                   # bpy.ops.object.particle_system_add
settings = emitter.particle_systems[0].settings         # bpy.types.ParticleSettings
settings.count = 200
settings.physics_type = 'NEWTON'
settings.render_type = 'COLLECTION'
settings.instance_collection = debris_collection
settings.use_rotation_instance = True
settings.factor_random = 2.0
```

### 11. Alembic export (survives cloth/soft-body deformation; FBX does not)

```python
bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')
cloth_plane.select_set(True)
bpy.ops.wm.alembic_export(                              # bpy.ops.wm.alembic_export
    filepath="//cloth_cache.abc", start=1, end=60, selected=True,
)
```

### 12. Applying scale before adding rigid body physics (recommended default habit)

```python
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = obj
bpy.ops.object.transform_apply(location=False, rotation=False, scale=True)   # bpy.ops.object.transform_apply
bpy.ops.rigidbody.object_add(type='ACTIVE')
obj.rigid_body.collision_shape = 'CONVEX_HULL'
```

### 13. Kinematic-handoff "throw" — the only way to give a rigid body initial velocity

```python
obj.rigid_body.kinematic = True
obj.rigid_body.keyframe_insert(data_path="kinematic", frame=1)
for f in range(1, 11):                                  # establish a real velocity over ≥2 frames
    obj.location = start + velocity * (f - 1)
    obj.keyframe_insert(data_path="location", frame=f)
obj.rigid_body.kinematic = False                        # release — sim inherits the established velocity
obj.rigid_body.keyframe_insert(data_path="kinematic", frame=11)
```

**Test scripts** (left on disk for reproduction/extension):
`<localappdata>\Temp\claude\<session-workspace>\<scratchpad>\blender_physics_research\t1_rigidbody.py`
through `t9_constraint_axis.py`, each paired with its `t*_result*.json` output.
