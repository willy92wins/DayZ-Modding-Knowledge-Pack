"""Propose whether a normal map is OpenGL (Y+) or DirectX (Y-) from measurement, not by eye.

DayZ `_nohq` is DirectX/Y- (SKILL.md rule 3). A source map of unknown convention is
otherwise a guess, and a wrong guess turns every groove into a ridge.

Two independent readings; a candidate needs both to agree, otherwise INCONCLUSIVE. A candidate
is not proof: both readings agreed on the wrong convention for a valid tangent-space bake on a
sphere patch and for undersampled tileable detail (R21 round 2). Confirm it independently (the
baker's export setting, or a render under a raking light) before inverting a channel. A raking
light confirms only if it crosses V (R21 round 3): the green changes the shading only through the
light's V component, so a light parallel to U, or a groove that runs along V, renders this map
and its inverted-green copy alike and leaves the check inconclusive. What confirms: a light from
the top or the bottom of the texture, a groove that runs along U, and the inverted copy reading
that groove as a ridge.

1. Albedo reading (the contributed `normal_convencion.py`, arithmetic unchanged, see
   Provenance): across a groove (a valley) the surface normals converge.
     - Red, X: +U is right in both conventions, so d(nx)/dx < 0 when a valley is crossed
       left to right.
     - Green, Y: in OpenGL +Y is +V, up in the image, so walking down the rows d(ny)/dy > 0
       (the opposite sign to red); in DirectX +Y points down and the sign equals red's.
   The grooves are found in the albedo: dirt collects in hollows, so a pixel darker than its
   blurred surroundings (a high-pass of the albedo) marks a hollow. The red channel calibrates
   the sign of that hollow signal; the green channel decides. It assumes the hollows curve the
   same way along both axes (pits, or grooves in both directions): on a surface whose
   curvature has opposite signs along the two axes the green correlation follows the geometry,
   not the convention, and the reading is wrong with strong correlations (R21 round 1).
2. Curl reading (added in review, no albedo): the slopes of a height field have no curl. With
   p = -nx/nz and q = ny/nz, d(p)/d(row) - d(q)/d(col) is ~0 under OpenGL and
   d(p)/d(row) + d(q)/d(col) is ~0 under DirectX. The smaller median residual wins if it is
   below CURL_RATIO times the other and the two differ by more than CURL_FLOOR, one 8-bit step
   of the normal (2/255). The floor is a heuristic, not a bound on rounding noise: where the
   normals are nearly flat (nz close to 1) rounding to 8 bits moves each residual by up to about
   one step, but dividing by a smaller nz amplifies that error. It was added after a vanilla map
   whose residuals sat half a step apart read OpenGL.
3. Block stability (added after a product test on vanilla maps, 2026-10-04): a candidate stands only
   if each reading keeps it across a BLOCK_GRID x BLOCK_GRID grid of blocks. Each block gets each
   reading's verdict from its own pixels (the derivatives, masks and thresholds of the whole map);
   among the blocks that name a convention, at most BLOCK_CURL_MAX_OPPOSED (curl) or
   BLOCK_ALBEDO_MAX_OPPOSED (albedo) may name the other one, and at least one must name the
   candidate. A really inverted convention inverts a reading wherever there is relief; a curved
   bake, a decal or a map stitched from two sources leaves blocks that disagree.

What it does NOT check: inverting the green channel of the same map only negates the green
correlation and swaps the two curl residuals, so it always flips the verdict and is no control.
The controls are maps of known convention (tests/test_normal_convention.py). A map that is not
a height field's slopes (painted, hand-edited, heavily compressed) can leave the curl reading
inconclusive. Nor does it tell which channel is off: both readings compare the green's sign with
the red's, so a map whose red is inverted against the real relief (X-, Y-) also reads OpenGL, and
inverting its green then gives a consistent map with the relief upside down. Check red on a
feature of known relief before choosing the channel. Nor does the block check see a map that
mixes the two conventions inside every block (known limit, accepted by the Pack owner on
2026-10-04): vanilla kancel_008_nohq, whose glass panes read DirectX and whose bolts and window
frames read OpenGL a few pixels away, reads OpenGL with stable blocks. Measured on three vanilla
samples: 1 wrong candidate in 502, 0 in the 165 not used to design the check.

Input: 8-bit PNG (or any format Pillow reads) of the same size. Convert a `.paa` first with
DayZ Tools ImageToPAA; a `_nohq` name makes it write the RGB normal.

Usage:
  python normal_convention.py --normal heater_Normal.png --albedo heater_BaseColor.png [--json]
Exit: 0 = both readings agree on a candidate (DirectX or OpenGL), stable across the blocks,
2 = INCONCLUSIVE, 1 = bad input.
JSON keeps the key "verdict" for that candidate.

Provenance: the albedo reading is adapted from LFPowerGrid_dev `assets/heater/normal_convencion.py`
(commit a4c6e29, 2026-09-21), written by the Pack owner with Claude, contributed through
pipeline ticket fb-20260921-164248-a140. MIT, like the rest of the Pack. Changes: command-line
paths instead of fixed ones, a non-finite correlation is INCONCLUSIVE (the original read NaN as
DirectX), a size check, JSON output (null for undefined numbers), and the curl reading with the
agreement rule, added after a cross-family review found a confident wrong verdict.
