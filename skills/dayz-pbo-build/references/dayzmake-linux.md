# Building, signing and publishing a mod with dayzmake and `workshop` (Linux, no DayZ Tools)

Turn a source tree into a Workshop-ready folder without Windows: **dayzmake** builds and signs the PBOs,
**`workshop`** (https://github.com/nozwock/steam-workshop-uploader) uploads the folder, and
`skills/_shared/scripts/dayz-mod-pack.sh` wires the two together. The Windows route (AddonBuilder, DsUtils,
Publisher, SteamCMD) is the rest of this skill and `workshop-publish.md`.

Source: bzed's own measurements, from `bzed/dayz-dev-plugin@6112ac5` `systems/mod-packaging.md` (cited as
`MP:<line>`), contributed to this Pack under its MIT licence by the author, who also wrote dayzmake. Platform:
Debian, Proton Hotfix for the DayZ Tools comparisons. End to end, a PBO built, signed and verified this way loaded
on a server with `-mod=@Mod` and `verifySignatures = 2`, and its scripts ran; The author re-tested the whole plugin on DayZ 1.30 stable (the author's report, 2026-11-13; build not recorded here). Not verified: the v3-against-v2 signature check on a real client (`MP:9-14`). The AutoTest mod
(`dayz-test-ingame/assets/autotest-mod`) builds, signs and verifies with this flow and dayzmake 1.0.0 in
`skills/_shared/tests/test_linux_helpers.py`.

## Get the right dayzmake

dayzmake is bzed's DayZ fork of armake2, renamed at `v1.0.0` (https://github.com/bzed/dayzmake). **Upstream armake2
leaves `*.c` files out of the signature**, so a script mod's `.bisign` does not cover its scripts, and it fails on
DayZ configs (`MP:16-20`). Use dayzmake >= 1.0.0, pinned: the release binary
`dayzmake-v1.0.0-debian-trixie-x86_64.tar.gz` from https://github.com/bzed/dayzmake/releases/tag/v1.0.0, or
`cargo install --git https://github.com/bzed/dayzmake --tag v1.0.0` (needs `libssl-dev`).

```sh
dayzmake -h 2>&1 | grep -- --proton-binarize   # a hit = the fork; none = upstream armake2, do not use
dayzmake --version                             # v1.0.0; pre-rename fork builds are called armake2 and print v0.3.0
```

The version string does not tell builds apart. If in doubt, reinstall from the tag, or binarize one textured model
both ways and `cmp` the results (`MP:45-49`). `dayz-mod-pack.sh` runs the same check: it uses `dayzmake` from `PATH`
(or the binary named by `$DAYZMAKE`, or the older `$ARMAKE2`), falls back to a pre-rename `armake2`, refuses upstream and warns below 1.0.0.

## Quick start (`dayz-mod-pack.sh`)

```sh
S=skills/_shared/scripts/dayz-mod-pack.sh
$S init MyMod                 # folders, .gitignore, .workshopignore; --servermod sets the Server tag
$S keygen                     # secrets/MyMod.biprivatekey (never committed) + keys/MyMod.bikey (public)
$S build                      # build/@MyMod/{addons,keys} (+ mod.cpp, meta.cpp): the upload folder
$S build --binarize-models    # also .p3d/.rtm MLOD -> ODOL through BI binarize under Proton
$S check                      # no key in git, history or the upload folder; every signature verifies
$S publish-hint               # prints the `workshop create|update` commands; does not run them
```

One `src/<Addon>/` per PBO; `ModName` becomes the key name (letters, digits, `_`); each addon's `$PREFIX$` defaults to its `src/<Addon>` folder name; `-C <dir>`
works on another project (`MP:55-90`). The private key lives in `secrets/`, outside everything that is packed or
uploaded: `build` aborts if one turns up in the content folder, `keygen` refuses unless `secrets/` is git-ignored (when the
project is inside a git work tree) and never overwrites a key, and `check` fails if a `.biprivatekey` is tracked or anywhere in history. A key that reached
git history or the Workshop is leaked: rotate it under a new name (`MyMod_V2`) so old and new coexist in `keys/`.
Do not commit `build/`: a signature is only valid for the exact PBO bytes (`MP:92-102`).

## What `build` and `pack` do

| Input | `dayzmake build` | `dayzmake pack` |
|---|---|---|
| `config.cpp` (any `*.cpp`) | preprocessed, rapified to `config.bin` | copied as text |
| `*.rvmat` | rapified | copied |
| `*.p3d`, `*.rtm` | copied as-is on Linux (warning `non-windows-binarization`) unless `--proton-binarize` | copied |
| `.c`, `.paa`, `.ogg`, `.wss`, ... | copied | copied |

(`MP:104-124`.) Scripts always stay text. Textures must already be `.paa`:
`dayzmake img2paa -t dxt5 -c in.png out_co.paa` (`-t dxt1` for opaque maps, power-of-two sizes; `paa2img` back;
measured with v1.0.0 on 2026-11-13). `--no-bin` (`dayzmake pack`) ships `config.cpp` untouched; a `$NOBIN$` or
`$NOBIN-NOTEST$` file disables binarization for one addon. `build` also warns about textures and materials an MLOD
references that are not in the addon (`missing-texture`, `missing-material`; `-w` silences).

### `--proton-binarize`

It copies every `.p3d`/`.rtm` into a temporary sandbox and Wine prefix (your sources stay MLOD), runs BI's
`binarize.exe` under Proton from a `P:` root with the addon mapped, builds, signs and deletes the sandbox. It finds DayZ
Tools and Proton under the Steam root (`STEAM_ROOT`, `DAYZ_TOOLS`, `PROTON` override) and fails with the binarize log
if a model does not convert (`MP:161-166`).

- **Texture alpha.** binarize resolves face texture paths relative to its current directory. Fork builds before
  `0a0ce3b` ran it from the `Binarize` folder, so no texture was found and nothing was printed: the ODOL lost the
  section flags `0x802020` (IsAlpha|IsTransparent|IsAlphaFog) and the face colour fell back to the not-found default
  (binarize 1.30.164200.56, 2026-10-31). From `7dcb3cf` (in `v1.0.0`) the output for a cube with a DXT5 `_ca.paa` is
  byte-identical to binarize run by hand from a `P:` root and to AddonBuilder's (binarize 1.30.164289.70,
  2026-11-03). Not checked in game (`MP:168-178`).
- **Keep Wine's `Z:` tiny.** Run by hand, binarize walks the tree under `Z:` (= `/`): it burned CPU for minutes
  listing `~/.cargo` and a CIFS mount, with or without the input file. Confined to a sandbox it took 3 s, exit 0. A
  model without textures binarizes from any directory (a hand-made MLOD triangle came out as ODOL); with textures the
  current directory must be the `P:` root, and vanilla `dz\...` textures are only found if they exist under `P:`
  (`MP:180-204`). `_shared/scripts/dayz-proton.sh binarize` and `_shared/linux-proton.md` section 3 do this setup.
- On Windows dayzmake finds `binarize_x64.exe` through `HKCU\Software\Bohemia Interactive\binarize` and `build`
  binarizes in one go (not tested).

### Checking dayzmake against BI's own tools

Run the same input through DayZ Tools under Proton (`dayz-proton.sh tool CfgConvert|DSSignFile|DSCheckSignatures`)
(`MP:210-225`, 2026-10-31):

- Compare CfgConvert and dayzmake **after `derapify`**, not byte for byte: CfgConvert writes a 4-byte offset after
  every class body and dayzmake does not. The decoded configs are identical and the game loads both.
- The DS tools print nothing on Proton's console; redirect through `cmd /c ... > file`.
- A PBO edited by hand needs its SHA-1 trailer recomputed (`\0` + `sha1(everything before it)`), or DSSignFile fails
  with "Stored and calculated hash don't match".

Bugs found against CfgConvert on 2026-10-31 and fixed in the fork (re-tested 2026-11-03 at `7dcb3cf`, all in
`v1.0.0`) (`MP:227-243`): an unquoted string value swallowed the rest of the file (`bcb2244`); an already-rapified
`.rvmat` failed `build` (`ae05ebd`); `#include "x.hpp"  // comment` failed (`45379fd`); `#include` was case-sensitive on
Linux (`d24b0c1`); a macro with the wrong argument count stayed unexpanded silently (`563b944`, `ec58d08`);
`__EVAL`/`__EXEC` were not evaluated (`f6465e9`, `b928152`); cp1252 entry names crashed `inspect`/`unpack`
(`698cfcf`, `173319f`). Fixed in 1.0.0 (re-tested 2026-11-13): `pack` of a file whose Linux name is not valid UTF-8 wrote
a PBO that `inspect`/`unpack` refused with `failed to fill whole buffer`; older builds need such a file renamed first
(`MP:245-249`).

## Signatures

(`MP:252-267`)

- `dayzmake keygen <path/Name>` writes `Name.biprivatekey` and `Name.bikey` (1024-bit RSA; the name is stored in both
  and in the signature's file name).
- `dayzmake sign <key.biprivatekey> <x.pbo>` writes `x.pbo.<KeyName>.bisign` beside the PBO, in the same `addons/`.
  Default is **v3**; `--v2` writes the older form (`build --v2` in the script), only if v3 is rejected.
- `dayzmake verify <Name.bikey> <x.pbo> [sig]` exits 0 for a valid signature.
- For a PBO with `config.bin`, a `.c` script and an rvmat, the fork's v3 `.bisign` was **byte-identical** to
  `DSSignFile.exe`'s, and `DSCheckSignatures.exe -deep` reported it OK (2026-10-31, under Proton). For a negative
  control see `dayz-test-ingame`, "A signature negative control that cannot fail".
- Sign after the final build; any change to the PBO, even a rebuild with another timestamp, invalidates the
  signature. Sign every PBO of a mod with one key, so one `.bikey` covers all.

## Other commands

```
dayzmake rapify | derapify | preprocess [src [dst]]   config.cpp <-> config.bin; stdin/stdout without paths
dayzmake build | pack [-x glob] [-e k=v] [-k key] <dir> [pbo]
dayzmake inspect <pbo | model.p3d>   PBO: header extensions + files; MLOD: LODs, textures, materials, selections
dayzmake unpack <pbo> <dir>          header lands in $PBOPREFIX$; no -x (v1.0.0)
dayzmake cat <pbo> <file> [dst]      one file; inner paths use \  ('scripts\5_Mission\x.c')
dayzmake img2paa | paa2img | binarize
```

Debug recipes (`MP:269-300`): `dayzmake preprocess src/MyMod/config.cpp | less` shows what the parser sees;
`dayzmake cat Vanilla.pbo config.bin | dayzmake derapify` shows what an official PBO set; `dayzmake inspect x.pbo` must
show `prefix=<what config.cpp's script paths start with>`, and with no `$PREFIX$`/`-e` the folder name becomes the
prefix. `$PREFIX$` holds one line `MyMod`, or `key=value` lines; `MyMod\Sub` for nested prefixes. The script adds
`-e product=dayz` beside `prefix=`.

## The upload folder: `mod.cpp`, `meta.cpp` and the app id

Checked against the 438 items of a local `workshop/content/221100` and the strings of DayZ Tools' Publisher
(`MP:302-347`):

| File | In real Workshop items | Holds the app id? | Written by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `addons/*.pbo` + `.bisign` | all; the Publisher refuses an upload without `addons/` at the root or with PBOs outside it | no | dayzmake |
| `keys/*.bikey` | most (some server-only items have none) | no | `keygen` |
| `mod.cpp` | 135 of 438 | **no, in none** | you, optionally |
| `meta.cpp` | 438 of 438 | **no** | the Publisher; `dayz-mod-pack.sh build` mirrors it |

- **The app id does not go into `mod.cpp`.** The Publisher reads it from its own `steam_appid.txt` (221100); the
  `workshop` uploader takes `--app-id 221100` and keeps it in `workshop.toml`, which is never uploaded.
- `mod.cpp` is optional: 303 of 438 items ship none, a mod works without it (the author's report, no build
  recorded), and a locally loaded `-mod=` folder works without `meta.cpp` and `mod.cpp`. Fields seen, most common
  first: `name`, `overview`, `tooltip`, `action`, `author`, `picture`, `logo`, `logoSmall`, `logoOver`, `version`,
  `authorID`. `picture`/`logo*` are paths inside a PBO.
- `meta.cpp` is `protocol = 1; publishedid = <item id>; name = "<title>"; timestamp = <n>;`, where `timestamp` is .NET
  `DateTime.ToBinary()` of the UTC upload time, `(unix_seconds + 62135596800) * 10^7 + 2^62`.
- The official Windows tools upload `publishedid = 0` on a first publish. That **does not work for DayZ clients**
  (server mods are fine). The upstream `workshop` uploader rewrites `meta.cpp` on every DayZ `create` and `update`
  (publishedid, fresh timestamp) before uploading (the author's test). Whether a client needs anything else from it
  was not tested.

## Workshop tags

(`MP:349-379`.) Exactly one **type** tag: `Mod` for a normal mod, `Server` for a servermod (`-servermod=`). Any number
of **content** tags: `Animation`, `Character`, `Economy`, `Environment`, `Equipment`, `Mechanics`, `Props`, `Sound`,
`Terrain`, `Vehicle`, `Weapon`. `Tag Review` is set by moderation; never set it. There is no `servermod` or
`Scenario` tag to use (the Publisher refuses `Mod` with `Scenario`). Of 434 items read through
`ISteamRemoteStorage/GetPublishedFileDetails`, all carried `Mod` and 14 carried `Mod` with `Server`; that predates the
rule, do not copy it. Not tested: whether both type tags at once, or none, is refused. The script keeps them as
`WORKSHOP_TAGS="Mod Weapon"` in `.dayzmod`; `check` fails without exactly one type tag; `publish-hint` turns them into
`-t` options. `update` must resend them, because Steam drops tags that are not sent.

## Uploading with `workshop`

(`MP:381-404`.) Steam must be running and logged in with an account that owns DayZ. Uploading publishes to Steam and
may be cached by clients: it is the user's decision, so run `check`, look at the content folder, and never run
`create`/`update` unprompted.

```sh
workshop create --app-id 221100 --content build/@MyMod --title "My Mod" -t Mod \
    --ignore-file .workshopignore --glob '!*.biprivatekey' --visibility private -m "first upload"
cp build/@MyMod/workshop.toml workshop.toml && git add workshop.toml     # the item id is not secret
workshop --no-prompt update --content build/@MyMod --ignore-file .workshopignore --glob '!*.biprivatekey' -m "changelog"
```

- `workshop.toml` (`app_id`, `item_id`, `tags`) tells `update` which item to overwrite; it is never uploaded.
- The uploader stages a filtered copy honouring `.ignore`/`.gitignore`, `--ignore-file` and `--glob` (case-sensitive,
  a leading `!` excludes). `--no-prompt` is a global option, so it goes before the subcommand.
- Start `private` (or `unlisted`), check the item, then make it public in Steam.

## Pitfalls

(`MP:406-415`.) A wrong or missing prefix loads the PBO but compiles none of its scripts (`files[]` resolves against the
prefix). `-servermod=` PBOs need no key on clients; `-mod=` PBOs do. `build` holds files in memory, so very large asset
mods need RAM to match. Before uploading, boot the result on a local server and compare script module counts with
vanilla (`dayz-test-ingame/references/linux-native-server.md`, section 4).
