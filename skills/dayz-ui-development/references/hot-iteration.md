# Hot iteration — edit a `.layout` on disk and see it in the running game

Measured 2026-08-19 on DayZ 1.29 (runs `3b63168d`, `4320d1d6`, `08343f0c`, `fdf07db7`).
Every number below came from the engine, not from reading source.

The short version: **a `.layout` under `$profile:` is re-read from disk on every load, so a
UI can be iterated in seconds instead of one repack-and-boot per change.** Everything else
on this page is the rule that makes it work and the four traps that make it look like it
does not.

---

## 1. The rule that decides everything

**An addon-prefixed path is served by the PBO and only by the PBO.** Not the work drive,
not a loose file next to the PBO, not a loose file at a path the PBO does not even contain.
Three separate measurements collapse into that one sentence:

| What was tried | Result |
|---|---|
| A loose `.c` on the work drive (`P:\`) | PBO wins (SP-078, July) |
| A loose `.layout` at a path the PBO **also** contains | PBO wins |
| A loose `.layout` at a path the PBO **does not** contain | Not visible at all — `FileExist` returns 0 |

The third row is the one that closes it, and it carries its own positive control: in the
same probe, `FileExist` returned **1** for a file that exists *only inside the PBO*. So the
0 on the loose path is a real absence, not a blind guard (run `4320d1d6`).

**The corollary people usually want next:** adding assets to a mod "hot" — dropping a
texture or a model into the mod folder of a running game — is closed by the same mechanism.
The addon prefix is not a directory the engine watches.

**The exception, and it is the useful one:** `$profile:` resolves to the client's
`-profiles=` directory, which is an ordinary writable folder outside any PBO. The engine
reads it on demand. That is the whole loop.

---

## 2. What actually got measured

Run `08343f0c`, client 1920×1080:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Does a `.layout` written from outside the game load? | Yes, from `$profile:` |
| Do the engine rects match an offline prediction of the same file? | Worst delta **4,15e-05 px** across 3 widgets |
| Is the file re-read on **every** call, or parsed once and cached? | **Re-read every call**: same path, different bytes → different rects (5,37e-05 px against the new prediction) |
| Does a missing path kill the client? | No, when guarded — see §4 |
| Does unloading leave anything behind? | No: after `Unlink()`, lookup by name returns `widget_not_found` |

The re-read row is the one that separates a design loop from a one-shot. Test it with
**two files that predict different geometry**, never with the same file twice — otherwise a
cached parse passes the test.

Run `fdf07db7` added textures: a `.paa` copied into `$profile:` draws identically to the
same file served by a PBO — means within 1/255, standard deviations within 0,8, with both a
positive and a negative control in the same frame. **So hot UI can carry its own imagery**,
not just boxes and text.

---

## 3. The loop

1. Write the `.layout` into the client's profile directory from outside the game.
2. Reload it in the running client.
3. Capture a frame; read back the engine rects.
4. Compare against the offline prediction; look at the frame.
5. Edit and repeat — no repack, no reboot.

With DayZ-MCP the reload is one verb:

```
ui_reload_layout(path="$profile:my_panel.layout")   # loads, returns the engine rects
ui_reload_layout(mode="close")                      # unlinks the preview
```

It returns the same node shape as `ui_tree`, so an existing rect comparison keeps working.
It needs a lease and it is client-side.

**Without DayZ-MCP** the same two engine calls work from your own mod code:

```c
WorkspaceWidget workspace = GetGame().GetWorkspace();
if (m_Preview)                       // ALWAYS first — see trap 2
{
    m_Preview.Unlink();              // 1_core\proto\EnWidgets.c:173
    m_Preview = null;
}
if (!FileExist(path))                // 1_core\proto\ensystem.c:397 — see trap 1
    return;
m_Preview = workspace.CreateWidgets(path);   // 1_core\proto\EnWidgets.c:181
```

`CreateWidgets(string layout, Widget parentWidget = NULL, bool immedUpdate = true)` — leave
`immedUpdate` at its default: with it, the rects are already correct **in the same call**,
no frame of waiting. That was measured, not assumed.

---

## 4. The four traps

**Trap 1 — `CreateWidgets` on a missing file kills the client inside the native call.**
No exception, no null return: the process dies. `FileExist` is the only guard, and it
resolves VFS paths (proved by the positive control in §1), so it is a real guard and not a
disk-only check. Guard every runtime load, always.

**Trap 2 — a second `CreateWidgets` STACKS, it does not replace.** Two loads leave two
trees on screen, the second drawn over the first. Symptoms: clicks land on the invisible
older copy, and a rect snapshot stops describing what is on screen. `Unlink()` the previous
root before every load. Cheap way to prove there is only one: unload and check the name is
gone — if a copy had been stacked, one would survive.

**Trap 3 — a UI texture that does not resolve paints a flat WHITE box and logs NOTHING.**
Not a hole, not a magenta placeholder, not a warning: the slot fills with white
(255, 255, 255, standard deviation **0,0**) and the client RPT says nothing at all — zero
lines for the missing name in 46 KB of log. If a design comes out white, suspect the texture
path long before the color or the style.

**Trap 4 — perfect rects say nothing about whether anything is drawn.** A panel can report
exactly the right rectangle and paint nothing. It happened with a style name that exists, is
the right type, and whose `Normal` state has an empty `Center` image — every automated check
passed and the panel was invisible. **Always end the loop with a frame**, and if you need a
mechanical verdict, put a positive and a negative control in the same frame so the eye is
comparing rather than judging.

---

## 5. What this loop does NOT give you

The preview shows **appearance, not behaviour**. Nothing wires a script class to the root,
so its buttons have no handlers; a preview is for geometry, color, text fit and imagery. To
exercise handlers, focus and hit-testing you still need the real menu.

Two things remain unmeasured, both cheap to fold into a future run: whether a **custom font**
and whether an **imageset** resolve from `$profile:`. Vanilla fonts and imagesets work
because they come from the game's own PBOs.

---

## 6. Measured 2026-08-20: what a rendered frame settled

Six flights and four probes against DayZ 1.29.163709, client at 1280x720 and 1920x1080,
every claim below anchored to a capture.

### `#STR_` keys DO resolve in a `$profile:` preview

One frame, four widgets, three sources — the positive control is the whole point:

| Widget | Text set in the layout | On screen |
|---|---|---|
| Title | `#STR_LFPG_ACTION_ADD_WAYPOINT` (another **mod**'s key) | **Add waypoint** |
| Message | literal, no key | renders, and **wraps across two lines** |
| BtnNo | `#STR_CfgWheel0` (**vanilla**) | **Rueda** |
| BtnYes | a key defined by no stringtable | `STR_UI_YES`, verbatim |

So the preview path is not the problem when a key prints raw: the key is simply not
defined. A template that ships `#STR_` placeholders without a `stringtable.csv`
reads as broken on first run, which is why one now ships beside these layouts.

### `GetText()` cannot judge key resolution — only the frame can

In that same frame, `ui_tree` reported `BtnNo.text == "#STR_CfgWheel0"` while the screen
showed **Rueda**. The engine substitutes at draw time and hands back what was assigned.
Any check of the form "read the widget text, see if it still starts with `#`" reports a
failure that is not happening. Two of seven widgets were readable at all
(`text_readable` was false for every `MultilineTextWidgetClass`), so the channel is both
partial and misleading.

### An unresolved key logs nothing, and cannot wrap

Zero RPT lines matched `STR_UI_` across a 49,340-byte client log. And the classic
"the title is clipped at both ends" symptom was the key, not the wrap: `STR_UI_MODAL_MESSAGE`
is a single token with no spaces, and `wrap` breaks on spaces. The same widget with real
prose wrapped correctly.

### Glyph height tracks the WIDGET height

`form_row.layout` loaded standalone has root `size 1 1`, so its `RowLabel` box is the whole
screen (measured 435x720 px at 720p) and it renders a single screen-filling letter. The
**same file**, with only the root changed to `size 0.30 0.05` — `RowLabel` becomes 130x36 px
— renders readable text. Nothing else was touched, `text_proportion` included. That is the
mechanism behind an oversized body: the box, not the font.

### `text_proportion` works on `TextWidget`, and is ignored on `MultilineTextWidget`

Settled 2026-08-21. The 2026-08-20 sweep below this heading used to say the question was
open; the null it measured was real, but the conclusion drawn from it was wrong. Two
flights, five cells each, every cell differing from an in-frame control in exactly one
thing. Glyph height read off the frame after removing the window chrome (the capture is
1302x776 for a 1280x720 client) and after checking that the gaps between boxes contain no
glyph rows — a band placed wrong shows up there first.

On `TextWidgetClass` the attribute is honoured and linear. Box height 108 px:

| Declared in the block | Glyph |
|---|---|
| nothing | 80 px |
| `text_proportion 0.20` | 16 px |
| `"exact text" 0` + `text_proportion 0.20` | 16 px |
| `"exact text" 0` + `text_proportion 0.60` | 47 px |
| `"exact text" 1` + `text_proportion 0.20` | 12 px |

One line fits the first four: **glyph = 0.74 x `text_proportion` x box height**, the
attribute defaulting to 1.0 when absent. Predicted 80 / 16.0 / 16.0 / 48.0 against measured
80 / 16 / 16 / 47. The 0.74 is the cap height of `sdf_MetronBook24` inside its em box, so
expect a different constant for a different font — the linearity is the transferable part,
not the number.

Two candidates that look like they should matter and do not:

- **`"exact text" 0` is not a prerequisite.** It was the obvious suspect: across the 821
  `.layout` files in this workspace, `"exact text"` sits in the *same widget block* as
  `text_proportion` in 82.6% of cases against a 3.1% base rate — a 27x enrichment. The
  frame refuted it. The cell with the flag and the cell without both measured 16 px.
  Convention in a corpus is evidence of how people write, not of what the engine reads.
  (`"exact text" 1` does do something: 12 px, which is the font's own size. That matches
  `SetTextExactSize`, whose header says "Exact Text flag must be enabled" —
  `P:\scripts\1_Core\proto\enwidgets.c:192`.)
- **Where the attribute sits inside the block is irrelevant.** Declared immediately after
  `name`, and declared last, both measured 16 px.

On `MultilineTextWidgetClass` the attribute is **ignored**. Same box, same font, same
`text_proportion 0.20`: **80 px** — indistinguishable from declaring nothing.
`MultilineTextWidget extends TextWidget` (`enwidgets.c:219`), so it inherits
`SetTextProportion` (`:216`) and the layout attribute still does nothing. An inherited
method is not a working behaviour. `wrap 1` on a multiline does change the rendered size
(80 -> 54 px, and 63 px once the text really splits across lines), but never toward the
requested proportion.

That is what the 2026-08-20 sweep hit: six values of `text_proportion` on
`MultilineTextWidgetClass Message`, no response, correctly measured. The sweep also
differed from today's cells in where the attribute was inserted, so at the time the two
explanations could not be separated. They can now: position was tested and does not
matter; class does.

### A PBO can mount and serve layouts while its own stringtable stays unread

Measured 2026-08-21 with a disposable addon. A `.layout` that exists **only inside the
PBO**, loaded by its addon prefix (`UITplStrings/probe_mount.layout`), renders — so the PBO
mounts and the engine serves files from it. In that same panel, a key defined by that same
PBO's `stringtable.csv` printed as its own name **with the leading `#` stripped**: the
engine recognised it as a localisation key, looked it up, and found nothing.

Three `CfgMods` differences against a shipping mod whose keys do resolve were then tested,
one per addon, with all five keys in one frame and a vanilla key as the positive control —
it printed **Rueda**, so the path does resolve keys that exist:

| Addon | Added to `CfgMods` | Its key on screen |
|---|---|---|
| baseline | — | raw |
| +prefix | `prefix = "..."` | raw |
| +deps | `dependencies[] = {"Game","World","Mission"}` | raw |
| +full | prefix, dependencies, picture, action, author, authorID, version, non-empty `units[]` | raw |

Every PBO was re-extracted after deployment to confirm its `stringtable.csv` was actually
inside. A negative from an addon that never carried the file looks identical and means
nothing.

So none of those three is the missing piece. The remaining structural difference against
the working mod is a `class defs` block declaring script modules — that is the next thing
to test, not a conclusion. **Practical impact is small**: every real mod has scripts, and
keys from real mods do resolve (see the table at the top of this section). What this does
establish is that a stringtable-only addon is not a valid minimal test case, and that the
failure is silent from end to end — zero RPT lines.

### A preview draws on top but receives no input

`ui_click` on a preview button does nothing, and neither does a real mouse click with the
inventory open — the preview renders **above** the inventory and still never focuses.
Measured: zero reddish pixels in the button band across four frames (unfocused, two timed
bursts, post-click), while the same detector found 1,767 reddish pixels elsewhere in the
frame. Draw order and input routing are separate; `CreateWidgets` gives the first without
the second, because nothing calls `SetActiveWindow` on the new root
(`P:\scripts\1_core\proto\EnWidgets.c:695`). Focus states, hover states and wheel
scrolling are therefore **not observable** in this loop at all — not by an agent, and not
by a human at the keyboard.

### Name resolution is global — prefix your preview widgets

`ui_click` / `ui_set_text` / `ui_tree` resolve by name through `FindAnyWidget`, which does
not care which tree a name came from. A preview whose widgets are called `BtnYes` or
`Title` collides with whatever else is loaded. Give hot-iteration layouts a prefix of their
own.

### Packaging note for the stringtable

A stringtable is addon-level: read from the PBO at load, so unlike a `$profile:` layout it
does not hot-reload. Two traps when building one: AddonBuilder's binarizing pass applies a
file whitelist and **drops `.csv` from the PBO** (pack with `-packonly`, or add the
extension to an include list), and in this workspace a `config.bin` produced by that same
pass has been measured not to register at all, with the mod mounting silently broken.

## Mod layouts: vanilla GUID textures can render white (added 2026-08-31)

A valid `{GUID}Gui/...edds` resource reference that works in a vanilla layout can still render as a
solid white rectangle when the same `imageTexture` form is used from a **mod layout**. The measured
case matched the vanilla `.meta` GUID and path byte-for-byte, painted 100% of the widget white, and
wrote no useful log. The unresolved boundary is GUID resolution versus layout provenance; do not
claim a bad asset from this symptom alone.

Use one of the deterministic routes instead:

- load a registered imageset through a supported `LoadImageFile("set:... image:...")` or RichText
  path; or
- ship a mod-owned `.paa` and reference it by the addon's packed prefix with normal path separators.

The second route was the positive control. This is the GUID-specific form of trap 3 above: if a mod
layout paints white, replace the resource route before changing color, alpha, or geometry.
