# Find the DayZ Server (Steam app 223350, or the Experimental Server 1042420 with -e) installed
# by the local Steam client.
#
# Prints the install directory on stdout and exits 0. Exits 1 with install instructions on
# stderr when no Steam library has it. Nothing is changed; only Steam's own metadata is read:
# every library listed in steamapps/libraryfolders.vdf is checked for appmanifest_223350.acf
# (the manifest is authoritative, the "apps" list in libraryfolders.vdf can lag behind).
#
# Usage: find-dayzserver.sh [-e] [-v]   -v also prints build id and install state on stderr
#        find-dayzserver.sh [-e] -w     print the DayZ client's workshop directory instead
#                                       (steamapps/workshop/content/221100, one dir per mod id)
#        -e  Experimental branch: server app 1042420 ("DayZ Server Exp"), client app 1024020
#            ("DayZ Exp"), whose workshop items live under content/1024020
# Env:   STEAM_ROOT   check this Steam root first
