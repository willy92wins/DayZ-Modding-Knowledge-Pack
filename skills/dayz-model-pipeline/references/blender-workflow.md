# Blender Workflow for DayZ Modding: Path C (External Models)

## Overview

This guide covers the manual Blender workflow for **Path C** of the DayZ model pipeline: when you have an external 3D model (from third-party sources, asset libraries, or other tools) that needs to be cleaned up and prepared for DayZ.

**This path is for:**
- Models downloaded from 3D asset stores
- Models created in other 3D applications (3ds Max, Maya, ZBrush, etc.)
- Externally-commissioned models
- Legacy assets needing conversion

**This path is NOT for:**
- Procedurally generated models (use Path A or B)
- Models created directly in Blender for DayZ (also use Path B workflows)

## Supported Import Formats

Blender can import the following formats suitable for DayZ:

| Format | Extension | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-----------|------|------|
| **Autodesk FBX** | `.fbx` | Best material/skeleton support, industry standard | Larger files, can contain junk data |
| **Wavefront OBJ** | `.obj` | Simple, widely compatible, clean | No materials or animations in file itself |
| **glTF/GLB** | `.glb` / `.gltf` | Modern, web standard, compact | Blender support varies by version |
| **Stereolithography** | `.stl` | Good for CAD imports | Geometry only, no UVs or materials |
| **Blender Native** | `.blend` | No import needed, fully compatible | Already in Blender format |

---

## Pre-Import Checklist

Before opening your model in Blender, verify these properties:

- [ ] **Model scale**: Is it in meters? Centimeters? Units unknown? (Affects DayZ scaling)
- [ ] **Polygon count**: Too many polygons will be optimized later (target: <2000 for small objects)
- [ ] **UV maps**: Are UV coordinates already present? Or will you need to unwrap?
- [ ] **Materials/textures**: Included in file? Separate files? Missing entirely?
- [ ] **Skeleton/armature**: If animated, is skeleton included and properly rigged?
- [ ] **Coordinate system**: Model created in Z-up or Y-up application? (Blender is Z-up; DayZ is Y-up)

Document these details before importing—they guide your cleanup strategy.

## Import Process (Blender Python Script)

Use these Python snippets to automate or semi-automate imports:

```python
import bpy

# Option 1: Clear scene and import FBX
bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
bpy.ops.object.delete()
bpy.ops.import_scene.fbx(filepath='/path/to/model.fbx')

# Option 2: Import OBJ
bpy.ops.wm.obj_import(filepath='/path/to/model.obj')

# Option 3: Import GLTF/GLB
bpy.ops.import_scene.gltf(filepath='/path/to/model.glb')

# Option 4: Open existing .blend file (no import, just open)
bpy.ops.wm.open_mainfile(filepath='/path/to/existing.blend')
```

**GUI Method:** File → Import → [format], then select your file.

---

## Post-Import Cleanup

After importing, your model likely needs cleanup. Follow these steps in order:

### 1. Check and Apply Scale

If the model isn't in meters, scale it to DayZ units:

```python
import bpy

obj = bpy.context.active_object

# If model was in centimeters, convert to meters (1cm = 0.01m)
obj.scale = (0.01, 0.01, 0.01)

# Apply the scale transformation
bpy.ops.object.transform_apply(scale=True)

# Verify: object should now be ~1 unit tall for a human-sized item
```

**Common conversions:**
- Centimeters → meters: multiply by 0.01
- Millimeters → meters: multiply by 0.001
- Feet → meters: multiply by 0.3048

### 2. Remove Extra Objects

Delete objects you don't need:

```python
# Deselect all first
bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')

# Select and delete cameras
for obj in bpy.data.objects:
    if obj.type == 'CAMERA':
        obj.select_set(True)
        bpy.ops.object.delete()

# Delete lights
for obj in bpy.data.objects:
    if obj.type == 'LIGHT':
        obj.select_set(True)
        bpy.ops.object.delete()

# Keep only mesh objects (and armature if animated)
```

### 3. Join Meshes

If the model is split into many separate mesh objects that should be one:

```python
# Select all mesh objects
bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')
for obj in bpy.data.objects:
    if obj.type == 'MESH':
        obj.select_set(True)

# Set the first mesh as active, then join
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = bpy.data.objects['MeshName']
bpy.ops.object.join()
```

### 4. Fix Normals

Ensure normals point outward (not inside):

```python
# Enter edit mode, select all, recalculate normals
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')
bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action='SELECT')
bpy.ops.mesh.normals_make_consistent(inside=False)
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
```

### 5. Remove Doubles

Clean up duplicate vertices that cause artifacts:

```python
# In edit mode, remove doubles
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')
bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action='SELECT')
bpy.ops.mesh.remove_doubles(threshold=0.0001)
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
```

### 6. Check Polygon Count

Verify your model won't be too heavy for DayZ:

```python
obj = bpy.context.active_object
poly_count = len(obj.data.polygons)
print(f"Polygon count: {poly_count}")

# For small objects, target <2000 polygons
# For medium objects, target <5000 polygons
# For large props, may go higher but requires LOD optimization
```

---

## Optimization for DayZ

DayZ models must be optimized to run smoothly in-game:

### Decimate (Reduce Polygon Count)

If your model is too dense:

```python
obj = bpy.context.active_object
decimate = obj.modifiers.new(name='Decimate', type='DECIMATE')
decimate.ratio = 0.5  # Reduce to 50% of original polygons
bpy.ops.object.modifier_apply(modifier='Decimate')
```

### Remove Interior Faces

Delete faces that will never be visible:

1. Enter edit mode (`Tab`)
2. Switch to face select mode (press `3`)
3. Select hidden/interior faces and delete them
4. Apply with `X` → Delete Faces

### Separate Moving Parts

If the model has moving parts (doors, switches, etc.), separate them into distinct objects:

```python
# In edit mode, select faces of one part
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')
bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action='DESELECT')
# Select desired faces with box select (B) or by material

# Separate into new object
bpy.ops.mesh.separate(type='SELECTED')
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
```

### Name Objects Meaningfully

For DayZ, name each object so it becomes a named selection later:

```python
# Rename the active object
bpy.context.active_object.name = 'body'

# List and rename multiple objects
for obj in bpy.data.objects:
    if 'Cube' in obj.name:
        obj.name = 'cover'
    elif 'Sphere' in obj.name:
        obj.name = 'light_lens'
```

---

## UV Preparation

UV maps control how textures wrap around your model. DayZ requires clean UVs:

### If Model Already Has UVs

Verify they're clean:
- No overlapping islands (causes baking artifacts)
- Proper margins between islands (prevents texture bleeding)
- Each material zone separated into its own UV island

### If Model Has No UVs

Use Smart UV Project:

```python
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')
bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action='SELECT')
bpy.ops.uv.smart_project(use_island_rotate=True, island_margin=0.02)
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
```

### Pack UV Islands

Ensure islands don't overlap:

```python
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')
bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action='SELECT')
bpy.ops.uv.pack_islands(margin=0.01)
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
```

---

## LOD Generation

DayZ uses Level-of-Detail (LOD) models to optimize performance. Create 2-4 LOD versions:

1. **LOD 0 (detailed)**: Full polygon count, used at close distance
2. **LOD 1 (medium)**: ~50% of LOD0 polygons
3. **LOD 2 (simple)**: ~25% of LOD0 polygons
4. **LOD 3 (distance)**: ~10% of LOD0 polygons (for very large objects)

### Generate LODs

```python
# Duplicate LOD0 for each LOD level
original = bpy.context.active_object

for lod_level, ratio in [(1, 0.5), (2, 0.25), (3, 0.1)]:
    # Duplicate
    bpy.ops.object.duplicate()
    lod_obj = bpy.context.active_object
    lod_obj.name = f'{original.name}_lod{lod_level}'

    # Add and apply decimate
    decimate = lod_obj.modifiers.new(name='Decimate', type='DECIMATE')
    decimate.ratio = ratio
    bpy.ops.object.modifier_apply(modifier='Decimate')
```

**Important**: After decimating, verify UVs didn't break. Re-pack if needed.

## Export for py3d Assembly

After cleanup and LOD generation, export for py3d to assemble into final `.p3d`:

### Export Settings (per LOD)

```python
# Export each LOD as OBJ with correct axis orientation for DayZ
# File > Export As > Wavefront (.obj)
```

**Critical export settings:**
- **Forward axis**: -Y (DayZ convention)
- **Up axis**: Z
- **Scale**: 1.0 (already scaled in cleanup step)
- **Apply modifiers**: Yes
- **Smooth groups**: Yes

Or via Python:

```python
bpy.ops.wm.obj_export(
    filepath='/output/model_lod0.obj',
    forward_axis='-Y',
    up_axis='Z',
    apply_modifiers=True
)
```

### Export Each LOD Separately

Export each LOD (LOD0, LOD1, LOD2, LOD3) as separate `.obj` files. py3d will combine them into the final `.p3d`.

---

## Coordinate System Gotcha

**This is critical**: Blender uses Z-up; DayZ uses Y-up.

| Application | Up Axis | Forward Axis |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **Blender** | Z | -Y |
| **DayZ** | Y | -Z |

When exporting OBJ for py3d assembly, use these settings:
- Forward: **-Y**
- Up: **Z**

This automatically converts from Blender's Z-up to DayZ's Y-up during export.

**If exporting raw and transforming in py3d**: apply transformation `x'=x, y'=z, z'=-y`.

---

## Texture Extraction and Naming

If your model came with textures, extract and rename them per DayZ conventions:

### DayZ Texture Naming

| Map Type | DayZ Suffix | Input Name Example |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Diffuse/Albedo | `_co.png` | `model_co.png` |
| Normal Map | `_nohq.png` | `model_nohq.png` |
| Specular/Roughness | `_smdi.png` | `model_smdi.png` |

### Extract and Convert

1. In Blender, bake textures to image files if needed
2. Use Substance Painter, Textura, or similar for channel repacking
3. Verify normal map convention (DirectX vs OpenGL—DayZ uses DirectX)
4. Save final textures to your mod's `data/model/` directory

If no textures came with the model, generate procedurally (see `procedural-textures.md`).

---

## Common Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Model appears tiny or huge** | Scale incorrect | Apply scale transform, verify units in meters |
| **Model is inside-out (black)** | Normals flipped | Recalculate normals outside: `normals_make_consistent(inside=False)` |
| **Black faces or holes** | Duplicate vertices | Run remove doubles with threshold 0.0001 |
| **UV seams visible in-game** | Tight UV margins | Re-pack islands with larger margin (0.02+) |
| **Model faces wrong direction** | Export axis wrong | Re-export with Forward=-Y, Up=Z |
| **Textures look stretched** | UVs not unwrapped properly | Run Smart UV Project, manual layout |
| **LODs are distorted** | Decimate broke geometry | Use Voxel Remesh modifier instead for preservation |
| **Smooth shading looks jagged** | Auto-smooth threshold too low | Increase auto-smooth angle (60-80 degrees typical) |

---

## Next Steps

After cleanup and export:

1. **Run py3d** to assemble OBJ files into `.p3d` with LODs
2. **Bake ambient occlusion** if textures need shading
3. **Add named selections** for interactive parts (doors, switches)
4. **Create model.cfg** for animations if applicable
5. **Pack PBO** and test in DayZ

See `py3d-assembly.md` for p3d assembly, and `config-cpp-objects.md` for final DayZ config.
