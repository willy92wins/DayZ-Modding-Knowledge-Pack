# DayZ Vehicle Structural Parity Checklist

> Generating a wheeled vehicle from scratch (procedural / Blender-to-DayZ) reveals the structural
> pieces a real DayZ vehicle has of stock ONE ERROR AT A TIME in-game. To avoid that whack-a-mole,
> debinarize a vanilla vehicle ONCE and diff against it BEFORE baking.
> Reference: civiliansedan (`DZ/vehicles/wheeled/civiliansedan/civiliansedan.p3d`, ODOL v54, debinarizable).
> Derived from the LFQuad F2 parity audit (2026-05-24). Cross-ref LL-030 (parity-first), LL-031 (gate by RPT).

## Parity-first method (do this BEFORE baking a vehicle)

1. Debinarize the civiliansedan (v54) with an external ODOL→MLOD converter whose ODOL reader handles v54.
2. Enumerate every LOD (resolution + `named_selections` + `proxies`) with the ODOL reader.
3. Diff against your model's read-back (py3d) and your `config.cpp`.
4. Build ALL missing pieces in one pass — do not discover them error-by-error in-game.

## Required LOD set for a functional wheeled vehicle

The civiliansedan ships 10 LODs: 6 visual + the special LODs below. A from-scratch vehicle needs at
minimum Geometry + Memory + ViewGeometry (if it has crew) + FireGeometry (if it takes damage).

| LOD | resolution | carries | needed when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Geometry | 1.0e13 | collision hull as `componentNN` + `wheel_X_X_damper_land` (wheel hubs as FACES, not only memory) + `seat_driver`/`seat_codriver` + door selections | always |
| Memory | 1.0e15 | crew/pos points, wheel axes, light points, particle points, `seat_con_*` | always |
| ViewGeometry | 6.0e15 | CREW PROXIES (`crewdriver`/`crewcodriver`/`crewcargoN`) as proxy objects + occlusion components + seats + wheels | if config declares `class Crew` |
| FireGeometry | 7.0e15 | damage-zone components + crew proxies + wheels (ballistic + damage) | if vehicle takes localized damage |
| LandContact | 2.0e15 | ground contact points | OPTIONAL — the civiliansedan has NO LandContact LOD. Do not add unless ground-settling demands it. |

## Crew proxies (the #1 post-spawn gotcha)

`config.cpp` `class Crew` → `Driver.proxyPos="crewdriver"`, `CoDriver.proxyPos="crewcodriver"`. The
engine then looks for crew PROXY OBJECTS named crewdriver/crewcodriver in the **ViewGeometry LOD** (and
FireGeometry). Memory points named crewdriver are NOT sufficient.

Symptom if missing: `PHYSICS (E): Proxy with bone name 'crewdriver' was not found in view geometry level
of model` (the vehicle still spawns, but get-in/crew is broken).

Vanilla proxy models: `\dz\vehicles\wheeled\proxies\crew_driver.p3d` (-> crewdriver) and
`\dz\vehicles\wheeled\proxies\crew_cargo.p3d` (-> crewcodriver, crewcargo1, crewcargo2). Place them at the
crew memory points (`crewdriver`/`crewcodriver` / `pos_driver`/`pos_codriver`).

## Lights

- Model visual LODs: selections `light_1_1`, `light_1_2`, `light_2_1`, `light_2_2`, `light_brake`,
  `light_brake_1_2`, `light_brake_2_2`, `light_reverse_1_2`, `light_reverse_2_2`, `light_dashboard`, `light_rear`.
- Model Memory LOD: `light_left`, `light_left_dir`, `light_right`, `light_right_dir`, `light_reverse`,
  `reflector_1_1`, `reflector_2_1`.
- Config (CarScript): `hiddenSelections[]` with the light_* selections; `hiddenSelectionsMaterials[]` ->
  a lights `.rvmat`; material-switch properties `frontReflectorMatOn/Off`, `brakeReflectorMatOn/Off`,
  `ReverseReflectorMatOn/Off`, `TailReflectorMatOn/Off`, `dashboardMatOn/Off`.

Without the selections + memory points + config, headlights mount but never illuminate.

## Damage

- Config: `class DamageSystem { class GlobalHealth { healthLevels[] } }` + `class DamageZones`
  (chassis, front, back, roof, engine, fueltank, fender_1_1/1_2/2_1/2_2, windowfront, windowback).
- Model: each zone maps to a component in FireGeometry + `dmgzone_*` selections across visual/ViewGeo/FireGeo/Memory.
- Wreck (DayZ cars): handled via destruction effects / material swap rather than a dedicated Wreck class
  in `wheeled/config.cpp` — verify the exact mechanism against the reference before relying on it.

Without DamageZones + FireGeometry components there is no localized damage and no wreck.

## AnimationSources (wheel / damper / steering)

The dampers need user animation sources: config `class AnimationSources` with `damper_1_1/2_1/1_2/2_2`
as `source="user"` (`initPhase` + `animPeriod`). Without this block: `unknown animation source damper`.
Wheel rotation (`source "wheel"`) and steering (`source "direction"`) are driven by the car simulation
when `Axles -> Wheels` (`animRotation`/`animTurn`/`wheelHub`) are correct AND the wheel hubs exist as
faces in the Geometry LOD (`wheel_X_X_damper_land`). `model.cfg` defines the animation classes; the
config wires them.

## Cross-reference

- LL-030 (parity-first), LL-031 (gate by RPT post-deploy).
- Tools: an external ODOL→MLOD converter (debinarize the reference; not distributed with this pack), skill `enforce-script-reference` (config blocks),
  `dayz-animation-pipeline` (model.cfg / AnimationSources), `dayz-particles` (damage effects).

## Addendum (2026-05-26) — Lessons from "the quad doesn't drive" debugging (LFQuad)

> Verified against civiliansedan v54 (full), hatchback_02/offroadhatchback/offroad_02 (FireGeo), and
> Croco quadbike v53 (header only). Marked [VERIFIED] vs [HYPOTHESIS] (rule R31: divergence
> with reference is candidate, not verdict; do not assert cause without reading mechanism).

### Vehicle that DOES NOT roll / sinks / bounces, with ENTIRE checklist present

If the vehicle spawns, steers, and makes sound but DOES NOT ROLL, SINKS, and BOUNCES, without RPT error, the
wheel PhysX simulation is not engaging. Key discriminator [VERIFIED]: "steers (steering animates) but
does not roll" = wheel recognized by config/anim but its physics (contact/suspension/rotation) blocked.

- Wheel hub CANNOT be inside the chassis convex hull [strong HYPOTHESIS]. Raycast wheel
  casts a ray downwards from hub; if it originates inside chassis collision, it auto-collides -> no
  ground contact -> no suspension (sinks) + no traction (doesn't roll). A single convex hull of entire
  body is INCORRECT: encompasses wheel space. Chassis needs wheel-wells (absent collision
  where wheels go): hull narrower than track, or multi-component with gaps. Verify offline
  that each hub remains OUTSIDE the hull and tire does not penetrate it.
- Silent failure (no RPT error) -> instrument, do not guess [PROCESS, R35]. Temporary debug script in
  vehicle's .c logging GetWheelCount(), wheel speed vs EngineGetRPM(), server vs client,
  contact. Observe failure. Loop "one hypothesis -> one change -> one test" prohibited.
- What is NOT the cause if cloned from a working vehicle [VERIFIED]: drivetrain (engine/torque/clutch/
  gearbox/differential), scripts (child CarScript; cosmetic differences), model.cfg. "Doesn't roll" failure
  is usually model/geometry or native binding, not the cloned config/script.

### Wheel-proxies in FireGeometry [VERIFIED 4/4 vanilla]

ALL reviewed vanilla cars carry wheel proxies in their FireGeometry LOD, identical to those in
Visual LOD (sedan sedanwheel.001-005, hatchback_02, niva, offroad_02). Replicate: copy wheel-proxies
from Visual to FireGeo (3-vertex proxy face + selection proxy:path.NNN, mass 0). Note: table in
memory-and-selections.md ("proxies NOT in FireGeo") applies to item-type attachments, NOT to wheels.

### Size of wheel_X_X_damper_land hub in Geometry [VERIFIED vs sedan]

SMALL convex component (~0.20x0.18x0.18, sedan), NOT a large box. A from-scratch build with boxes of
~0.40 is 2x too large and reaches almost down to the ground.

### Mass, COM, and suspension scale with the vehicle [VERIFIED vs Croco]

- Mass is computed from vertex weights in Geometry LOD. A real quad weighs ~1000 kg (Croco
  ModelInfo: mass 1061.5, COM (0, 0.474, -0.011)), NOT the ~250 default of a procedural hull. Too
  low mass -> unstable physics (bounce).
- Suspension (stiffness/compression/damping) scales with mass: DO NOT clone that of a heavy crawler
  onto a light quad (brutally stiff springs -> bounce). Clone from comparable mass.
- wheelHubRadius = radius of HUB COMPONENT (small ~0.11-0.15), NOT tire radius (BI doc).
  Croco 0.11 (tire 0.367); sedan 0.15.
- Wheel radius vs belly clearance: wheel contact ~Y=0 and chassis underside well above (sedan
  belly clearance 0.428 m). Small wheels -> body rides too low.

### Wreck [VERIFICADO sedan]

The sedan ships 3 dedicated directional wreck .p3d files (wreck/_wreckedfront/back/both.p3d) + script-side
spawn (no wreck= or class Wrecked* in wheeled/config.cpp). Empty healthLevels {} is valid.

### Tools / reference parity [VERIFIED]

- Croco quadbike v53: NOT full-debinarizable (desync in EmbeddedMaterial v53), but header/ModelInfo
  YES (mass, COM, geometry_center, LOD resolutions) by monkeypatching LOD.read to skip geometry
  parsing. For its real geometry -> Object Builder (handles v53).
- The debinarizer INVERTS winding (ODOL->MLOD) -> a debinarized MLOD is NOT a reliable winding
  reference. For collision winding use Check C (cross vs component centroid).
- Working quad LOD set (Croco): visual 0-6, shadow 1100, Geometry 1e13, Memory 1e15, ViewGeo
  6e15, FireGeo 7e15 (without LandContact).

## Addendum (2026-05-29) — Wheel proxy `.p3d` Memory anatomy (T1-D) [VERIFICADO vs Croco]

> This section covers the `.p3d` of the **wheel attachment** (the separate file referenced
> from `CfgNonAIVehicles` `ProxyVehiclePart` and tied to the body via `inventorySlot`), not the
> body. It is where the bug that went unnoticed between 2026-05-26 and 2026-05-29 (4
> sessions) resided, source of permanent `contact=0` and divergent bounce. See LL-057 for the
> process lesson, this addendum for technical anatomy.

### The wheel proxy `.p3d` is NOT "a wheel with visual LODs". PhysX uses its Memory LOD to build the wheel collider.

Without the 5 canonical selections in the wheel proxy's Memory LOD, **PhysX does not know the size
of the wheel collider** and defaults to the proxy's Geometry LOD (typically an 8v 0.20³
proxy cube generated by `dayz-model-pipeline` when creating from scratch). The effective
wheel collider ends up the size of a tiny cube instead of a wheel Ø(2×radius).
Symptom: `wheelCount=N wheelPresent=N` (wheels attached OK) but `contact=0` always after
first in-game frame (wheel→ground raycast only reaches ±0.10 m below hub anchor
instead of ±radius). Result: body falls freely until chassis Geometry collides,
cumulative divergent bounce, eventually `speedo` exceeds finite range and engine
executes `Will delete object with !finite or outside world coords`.

### The 5 canonical mem-points (extracted from Croco `quadbike_wheel.p3d` v53, debinarized 2026-05-27)

Each is a `Selection` of 1 unique point in the Memory LOD (resolution 1e15). All follow
the Croco-vanilla convention (Y vertical/radial, X axial/width, Z radial with intentional
inversion between min and max).

| Selection | Croco citation (front wheel) | Meaning | Scaling to custom wheel |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ce_center` | `(−1e-05, 0.0, 0.0)` ≈ (0,0,0) | collider center | always origin |
| `ce_radius` | `(3e-05, 0.37679, 0.40015)` | radius marker (Y) + width marker (Z) | `(0, wheel_radius, ce_radius_Z)` — preserve Croco Z/Y ratio (~1.062×Y) |
| `boundingbox_min` | `(−0.19095, −0.3816, +0.38558)` | min corner with **positive Z** | `(−width/2, −wheel_radius, +wheel_radius)` |
| `boundingbox_max` | `(+0.20446, +0.39014, −0.38393)` | max corner with **negative Z** | `(+width/2, +wheel_radius, −wheel_radius)` |
| `invview` | `(−0.23026, −1e-05, 0.0)` | negative X offset (likely for view inversion) | preserve offset relative to axial width |

**Non-standard quirk**: `boundingbox_min.Z > boundingbox_max.Z` (Z inverted between min and max).
DO NOT normalize — it is BI/PhysX convention for wheel proxies. Copy literally scaling Y/Z
with `factor_radial = wheel_radius / 0.38587` and X with `factor_axial = width / 0.39541`.

### How to build them with py3d 1.0.0 (cross-ref to `dayz-animation-pipeline` anchor 6)

All 6 quirks of py3d 1.0.0 apply (constructor with args, int weight, rebind after grow,
lowercase matname, overwrite-in-place for `ce_center` if it already exists, +Z/-Z frame if
wheel comes from Blender). See `references/py3d-1.0.0-quirks.md` in skill
`dayz-animation-pipeline`. DO NOT duplicate pattern here — animation pipeline skill
is canonical source for writing Memory LODs via py3d.

### Acceptance criterion (R26) for wheel proxies generated from scratch

Before declaring a wheel proxy "ready", verify with py3d:

```python
mem = next(l for l in p3d.lods if abs(l.resolution - 1e15) < 1e12)
required = {"ce_center", "ce_radius", "boundingbox_min", "boundingbox_max", "invview"}
missing = required - set(mem.selections.keys())
assert not missing, f"wheel proxy Memory incomplete: missing {missing}"
```

This must be part of the post-bake round-trip for any wheel proxy and must enter
the project's `product-spec.md` as a verifiable anatomical criterion, not as optional
backlog (LL-057).

### The audit covers it (cross-ref)

`dayz-p3d-audit` Silent Killer #11 (added 2026-05-29) covers the case. If you audit a wheel
proxy and it returns PASS with only `ce_center`, the check did not cover this dimension —
run the updated skill.

## Addendum (2026-05-30) — Canonical car-build invariants (Landrover tutorial + Bohemia + PhysX) [VERIFICADO fuente primaria]

> What it resolves: LFQuad shipped bouncing/launching on spawn despite 4+ iterations. The missing
> piece was NOT ride-height (that was a real divergence but NOT the launch mechanism). It is
> **how Geometry/mass is built**. This addendum encodes the canonical build method for
> a DayZ car, cross-referencing the step-by-step **Tyson89/Landrover** tutorial (wiki + repo), official
> Bohemia doc, and NVIDIA PhysX doc. Provenance: subagents that fetched and cited VERBATIM the
> actual pages/files (not memory). Mark [DOC] = documented with source; [MEASURED] = measured in

### Authoritative external references (ALWAYS cite when building a car; added to this skill by request)

- **Step-by-step tutorial (drivable car from scratch):** `https://github.com/Tyson89/Landrover/wiki` — 4 pages:
  [Home], [config.cpp](https://github.com/Tyson89/Landrover/wiki/config.cpp),
  [Object-Builder](https://github.com/Tyson89/Landrover/wiki/Object-Builder),
  [SimulationModule](https://github.com/Tyson89/Landrover/wiki/SimulationModule). Repo (config.cpp +
  Landrover.cfg model.cfg, branch `main`, ADPL-SA license): `https://github.com/Tyson89/Landrover`.
  It is the concrete example of "how to do it right" — primary reference for any new car.
- **Official Bohemia:** `https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Vehicle_Configuration` (Geometry LOD +
  per-vertex mass → total mass + CoM; wheel hubs as separate components; wheel-proxy in FireGeo;
  Diag tool in-game). `https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/LOD` (thickness ≥0.5 m; "Mass distribution is
  critically important … Inertia/Moment of Inertia"; "flying tanks" from geometry protruding in the
  PhysX LOD). `https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Validating_Geometries` (Find Non-Convexities /
  Convex Hull; closed+convex or it doesn't work). `https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Oxygen_2_-_Manual`
  (Find Components; "Geometry components must be closed convex objects"; <15 cm doesn't collide at speed).
  `https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3:_Cars_Config_Guidelines` (PhysX LOD 4e13 separate; CoM
  centered left-right; `sprungMass` sum = weight).
- **Launch mechanism (PhysX):** `https://nvidia-omniverse.github.io/PhysX/physx/5.1.3/docs/BestPractices.html`
  — section "Overlapping objects explode": bodies created overlapping "may explode, because the SDK tries
  to resolve the penetrations in a single time-step, which can lead to large velocities." Engine
  workaround: `setMaxDepenetrationVelocity` (not exposed to modders; engine clamps internally, but
  bad geometry triggers it anyway). Arma community "Anti-Bounce System" (Steam 2191542091): bounce upon
  contact is caused by "sharp edges in geometries which apparently impart a large moment to the vehicle,
  thus sending it up into the air" [CONSENSUS, matches PhysX mechanism].

### The build invariant of the Geometry LOD (what was missing)

**The Geometry of a working car is a COMPOSITE of several closed convex components, NEVER a
monolithic hull.** [DOC] Landrover Object-Builder checklist (verbatim): "Convex Components / Property
Name 'autocenter' value '0' / Simple Shape - No unnecessary components / **Applied a Mass on ALL
components** / Wheel hubs present and selections assigned / Center of Mass". Bohemia: "convex components.
Every component's vertex should have weight assigned. From these weights the total mass of vehicle and its
center of mass is computed." (Croco quad = **23 chassis components + 4 hubs**; LFQuad shipped with **1**
`component01` hoarding ~90% of mass — anti-pattern.)

Consequences of building it as a monolith (the two legs of LFQuad's bounce, SAME root):
1. **Trigger (shape):** a single tightly fitted convex hull with sharp edges, upon waking rigid body on
   spawn, overlaps terrain/hubs → PhysX resolves penetration in one step → huge impulse → launch
   ([DOC] NVIDIA; [CONSENSUS] ABS "sharp edges … large moment").
2. **Amplifier (inertia):** mass concentrated in 1 component → pathological/low inertia tensor
   (LFQuad Izz **128.5** = 37% of Croco **350.7** [MEASURED]) → any impulse spins/flips it →
   re-penetrates → gains energy → `Will delete object with !finite or outside world coords`. [DOC] LOD wiki:
   "the Mass distribution is critically important for the Objects physical behavior [Inertia / Moment of
   Inertia]".

### Canonical checklist (each point offline-verifiable; add to round-trip and product-spec)

| # | Rule | Source | Check |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Geometry = multiple **closed** convex `componentNN` (no monolith) | [DOC] Validating_Geometries / Oxygen2 / Landrover | clean `Find Non-Convexities` + `Find Non-Closed`; component count > 1 for the chassis |
| 2 | **Mass on ALL components** (incl. 4 hubs), not concentrated in one | [DOC] Landrover + Bohemia | sum weight per component; none at 0; none >~60% of total |
| 3 | `autocenter = 0` as named property on **each** Geometry component | [DOC] Landrover Object-Builder | read named properties per component (extends Killer #3 from audit to vehicles) |
| 4 | CoM **centered in X** (left-right); reasonable Y/Z, no large bias | [DOC] Landrover + Arma3 Cars | `CoM.x ≈ 0`; LFQuad CoM (0, 0.513, **+0.399**) vs Croco (0, 0.474, −0.011) [MEASURED] → large Z bias |
| 5 | Component thickness ≥ 0.5 m (a quad is narrow: Croco chassis ±0.275 = 0.55 m) | [DOC] LOD wiki | chassis component width ≥0.5 m (LFQuad post-D4H ±0.175 = 0.35 m ✗ — revert) |
| 6 | Hubs `wheel_X_X_damper_land` = real convex components with mass, NOT just face selections | [DOC] Landrover + Bohemia | each hub is a closed component with weight (not C.9 patch) |
| 7 | Proxies (wheel/crew/doors) **NOT** in Geometry LOD (they don't animate, don't collide there) | [DOC] Landrover Object-Builder | Geometry without proxies; wheel-proxies yes in Visual+ViewGeo+FireGeo |
| 8 | Fire Geometry mandatory in vehicles | [DOC] Landrover Object-Builder | FireGeo present |
| 9 | `drown_engine` memory point defined (if missing → 0 0 0 → engine drowns at origin) | [DOC] Landrover Object-Builder | point present and positioned at the engine |

### Suspensión: calibrada a la masa (fórmula documentada)

[DOC] Landrover SimulationModule: "Stiffness … needs to overcome the Kilogram that is going down by the
force of gravity"; starting point `compression = stiffness / 10`, `damping = compression * 3` (then
adjust). **VERBATIM reference config from Landrover** (AWD, ~landrover; only as an order-of-magnitude
anchor, do not copy blindly to a quad):

```cpp
class Suspension { stiffness=40000; compression=2100; damping=5400; travelMaxUp=0.10; travelMaxDown=0.06; };
wheelHubMass=15;      // KG, only applies if wheel is NOT attached
wheelHubRadius=0.284; // measured from hub component (Shift+E, Y axis), never negative
```

Comparison [MEASURED]: Croco stiffness 40000–41000; **LFQuad 20000** (half), damping 9000, travelMaxUp
0.293/0.414. Documented trap: mass too LOW + stiffness copied from a heavier vehicle →
catapult. (LFQuad is NOT in that trap: its mass is correct 1061.5 and its stiffness is lower than the
reference — suspension is NOT the bounce trigger; confirmed in-game D4H and by an identical community
case where swapping suspension/damping did not cure "floating/bouncing": *"both ways did not work … I'm
starting to think it's something else"*.)

### model.cfg — `suspension_damper` pattern (resolves recurring minValue/maxValue vs offsets doubt)

[DOC] Landrover repo `Landrover.cfg` VERBATIM. **`minValue=0` / `maxValue=1` fixed; actual travel is
driven by offsets** (NOT vice versa):

```cpp
class suspension_damper_1_1 {
    type="translation"; source="damper_1_1"; selection="wheel_1_1_damper";
    axis="wheel_1_1_damper_axis";
    minValue=0.0; maxValue=1.0;        // FRONT (rear uses maxValue=0.6, visual only)
    offset0=0.05;  offset1=-0.35;      // travel: +0.05 (above rest) to −0.35 (compression)
};
// config.cpp AnimationSources: class damper_1_1 { source="user"; initPhase=0.4857; animPeriod=1; }
//   initPhase sets the visual position of the damper AT REST (front ~0.486, rear ~0.400).
```

Skeleton [DOC]: front = `damper → steering → wheel` (3 levels, with steering bone); rear =
`damper → wheel` (without steering bone). Damper `source` (`damper_1_1`…) matches `animDamper` in
config `Axles→Wheels` and the `AnimationSources` class.

### config.cpp — mass is NOT in config

[DOC] The Landrover repo does NOT have `mass`/`sprungMass`/`centerOfMass`/`geometryClass` in config.cpp. Mass
is set ONLY via vertex weights in Geometry LOD (Object Builder, Alt+M). Do not attempt setting mass via
config in DayZ CarScript.

### What Landrover does NOT cover (gaps — keep using Bohemia/Croco)

- No troubleshooting section for "car bounces/flies" (it is a build guide, not a bug guide).
- No coverage of **PhysX LOD 4e13** separate from Geometry 1e13 (Arma does require it —
  `[TBD-verify vs Croco/DayZ]` whether DayZ cars have it). Resolution LOD and View Geometry = "TBD".
- No `sprungMass`; no total mass numbers. Geometry-mass→CoM→inertia remains the Bohemia source.

## Addendum (2026-05-30b) — Per-LOD content map, memory-point catalog, proxy placement, LOD verbatim [VERIFICADO fuente primaria]

### What goes into each car LOD

| LOD | resolution | Car content | Bohemia quote (verbatim) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resolution 0–N | 0,1,4,8 | visual mesh + wheel/crew/door proxies in EVERY visual LOD where they should appear | "Proxies need to be included in every resolution LOD that they should appear in."

Wheel hubs should have their own components" (DayZ wiki) |
| Memory | 1.0e15 | ALL memory points (catalog below): crew pos/dir, wheel axes, damper axes, light points, `drown_engine`, dials | "Named Selections used to define lights, vehicle entry points … control points for Animations" |
| LandContact | 2.0e15 | ground contact vertices (OPTIONAL in DayZ cars — civiliansedan does not have it) | "Contains only vertices that represent contact with land … mainly for vehicles. Wrong positioned points can cause 'levitation' or 'submerge'" |
| Roadway | 3.0e15 | walkable surface (roof/hood if player can stand on it) — not mandatory | "If a unit is supposed to be able to stand on top of a model … Make sure that a RoadwayLOD doesn't overlap with a GeometryLOD, or the unit will start to wobble" |

### PhysX LOD 4e13: Arma-3 yes, DayZ no (resolves previous [TBD-verify])

Addendum 2026-05-30 left `[TBD-verify vs Croco/DayZ]` whether DayZ cars have a separate PhysX LOD 4e13
from Geometry 1e13. Resolved: it is **Arma-3**. `Arma_3_Cars_Config_Guidelines` (verbatim): "There needs to be a
lod (4e13) consisting of convex components as simple as possible … Just the main body of car should be in
this lod, wheels are added by engine later." DayZ **references** (Landrover, QuadBike, Croco,
civiliansedan) use **Geometry 1e13 without a separate 4e13**. → Do NOT add a 4e13 LOD to a DayZ car unless
verified in-game.

### Nuance correction: "flying tanks" ≠ spawn bounce

Addendum 2026-05-30 cited the "flying tanks" quote from the LOD wiki to support the bounce mechanism. Verified
nuance: that quote is specific to **cannon/turret barrels that PROTRUDE in the PhysX LOD** ("the
collision of a barrel with the environment will cause the tank … to move very violently … flying tanks"),
NOT spawn depenetration bounce. The spawn bounce mechanism remains: PhysX resolves interpenetration
in one step → impulse (NVIDIA "Overlapping objects explode") + sharp edges (ABS,
community). Both are real but distinct; do not conflate them. (No explicit Bohemia quote was found for
"spawn-bounce due to geometry protruding below the origin" → that link remains `[verify in-game]`.)

## Correction (2026-05-30c) — Croco Geometry is extractable; the 2026-05-26 Object Builder note is stale

The Addendum 2026-05-26 note above says the Croco quadbike v53 is "NO full-debinarizable" and routes real geometry to Object Builder. That was true for the early parser state, but it is stale for the current LFQuad ROUND-2 workflow.

Verified current state:
- `AI/10_Projects/LFQuad/research/2026-05-27-croco-geometry-extracted-v53.md:76-82`: material v16 was resolved; all 12 LODs parse; a complete Croco MLOD was generated; Geometry LOD is OK with hubs + 27 convex components + `class=vehicle`.
- `AI/30_Sessions/2026-05-30-LFQuad-round2-spec-y-debinarizer-verdict.md:7`: `croco_extracted/quadbike_mlod.p3d` is usable, with round-trip OK since 2026-05-27; the residual debinarizer gap only affects visual LODs >16KB and has zero leverage for the bounce fix.
- `AI/30_Sessions/2026-05-30-LFQuad-round2-spec-y-debinarizer-verdict.md:13,16`: ROUND-2 should use py3d on the Geometry LOD, mirroring the extracted Croco; do not improve the debinarizer or fall back to Object Builder for this geometry task.

Operational rule: for car Geometry parity, use `croco_extracted\quadbike_mlod.p3d` / `croco_extracted\quadbike_mlod.p3d`-derived data as the quantitative reference. Treat the 2026-05-26 "Object Builder" sentence as historical context only, not current guidance.

## (added 2026-06-05) Geometry LOD named property `class=vehicle` -- required parity (SP-012b)

The Geometry LOD of every vanilla wheeled vehicle carries the named property `class = vehicle`
(alongside `autocenter = 0`). Verified universal -- civiliansedan, sedan_02, hatchback_02,
offroadhatchback, offroad_02, truck_01: 6/6 have `('class','vehicle')` on their Geometry LOD. It
flags the Geometry as a VEHICLE physics body. A procedurally-assembled Geometry that sets only
`autocenter=0` (the common py3d mistake -- assemble scripts set autocenter but never `class`) omits
it. Replicate it: `geo_lod.properties['class'] = 'vehicle'`, write back, confirm
`strings model.p3d | grep -c vehicle`.

Causation caveat (R31, verified in-game 2026-05-27): adding `class=vehicle` did NOT fix LFQuad's
`WheelCountPresent()==0` -- it was deployed, confirmed present in the binarized Geometry LOD, and the
in-game result was unchanged. So treat `class=vehicle` as REQUIRED PARITY (6/6 vanilla carry it; a
vehicle build must replicate it and it is cheap), NOT as the proven wheel-simulation gate. The
actual silent wheel-sim gate verified in-game is the `CfgSlots.selection` <-> FireGeometry proxy
selection consistency rule (see `enforce-script-reference`, wheel attachment / SP-017). Origin:
SP-012b, LFQuad bug-ledger UPDATE 8/10.

(Merged 2026-07-06 from the `dayz-model-pipeline` fork copy -- LL-110 dedup.)

## Correction (2026-06-01) — spawn-launch is wheel-collision + placement, NOT mass/inertia [VERIFIED probe + in-game]

> Refutes the CAUSE framework of Addendum 2026-05-30 (which attributed bounce to monolithic hull/sharp
> edges as trigger + low inertia as amplifier). The multi-component construction method
> from that addendum remains valid parity; what is corrected is **what causes the launch**.

- **Mass/CoM/inertia REFUTED as trigger [VERIFIED probe]:** a body with mass re-biased to authoritative
  Croco CoM (Y 0.474) + roll inertia ~209 (≈ Croco 215) **bounced identically** (spd 15.1 at t0.5,
  matching to 3 digits). Spawn impulse is ~vertical with constant total mass → by physics `v~J/m` is
  independent of mass DISTRIBUTION. Convex decomposition and mass distribution are **orthogonal**
  levers (SP-019): splitting the monolith does not move CoM/inertia and does not stop bounce by itself.
- **Croco's "Izz 350.7" was a uniform-mass artifact of the MLOD** (stripped); real roll inertia
  from the ODOL header is ~215 (SP-019). The "37% of Croco" comparison used the artifact.
- **Cause #1 MEASURED (PHASE 2): chassis Geometry OVERLAPS wheel volume.** Each wheel center
  (`*_damper_land`) has chassis points at 0.16-0.19 m (tire radius 0.34) vs clean Croco 0.43-0.46 m.
  The engine wheel collider self-penetrates with the chassis → PhysX ejects (the mechanism
  "overlapping objects explode" is real, but overlap is chassis-vs-WHEEL, not monolith-vs-terrain).
  Fixed: in-game wheels proceed to make contact (`wc` 0→1111 at t0.3).
- **Cause #2 MEASURED (in-game, side-by-side): placement.** Even with #1 fixed, LFQuad spawns at
  h=−0.264 (origin below surface) vs Croco +0.216 → buried wheels → ejection. Trace
  mechanism **unresolved** (research 2026-06-01); do not claim "ECE traces over Geometry Y_min" as general
  fact (matches LFQuad but Croco +0.216 does not fit).
- **Still valid from 2026-05-30:** Geometry = multiple closed convex components + mass in all (Croco
  23 chassis + 4 hubs) is **real parity**, but it is parity, NOT the bounce trigger.

---

## Addendum (2026-06-01) — wheel-well clearance vs radius, wheel cylinder, contact diagnostics, mass-safe edit [VERIFIED]

### Killer check: wheel-well clearance against tire RADIUS (not hub box)

The old check "hubs outside hull" validated only the 8-pt hub box, NOT the full wheel cylinder
→ overlap slipped through. Correct, measurable check: for each wheel center (`*_damper_land`
centroid), **no chassis (non-hub) collision point may fall inside the tire radius**
(config `radius`, ~0.34, NOT the small `wheelHubRadius`). Target = reference clearance (radius +
~0.07-0.09 m). [VERIFIED: LFQuad 0.16-0.19 < 0.34 = overlap → bounce; Croco 0.43-0.46, 0 inside;
script `wheel_overlap.py`]. Across travel: clear in X (lateral) → well holds when
wheel moves up under compression.

### WHEEL `.p3d` Geometry must be a cylinder ~radius, NOT a box

A box with semi-axis = radius has **corners at radius·√2 (+42%)** → oversized square collider.
[VERIFIED: LFQuad wheel box, corners 0.482 vs config 0.34; Croco 24-pt cylinder, uniform radial
0.340-0.366; check: `radial(Y-Z)` from center ≈ radius and uniform — box ⇒ max=min·√2;
script `wheel_geo_inspect.py`]. And wheel `.p3d` needs **ViewGeo + FireGeo** (Croco has them;
a from-scratch build often omits them). Construct the cylinder: N-gon in Y-Z (radius) extruded in X (width) →
`scipy.ConvexHull` yields outward faces+normals; sel `component01` over all pts/faces; add LODs
ViewGeo (6e15) and FireGeo (7e15, sels `component01`+`wheel`). [VERIFIED: round-trip py3d + binarizes
in-game]. Wheel FireGeo must have penetration material on its faces (rubber/metalplate like
Croco); `material=""` degrades ballistics/surface (does not block spawn/contact).

### Reference collision = decomposition into NON-uniform convex boxes (not fine mesh, not uniform grid, not arbitrary hull)

[VERIFIED: Croco Geometry = 23 skewed 8-pt boxes sized to the body (spine X±0.13, slabs
X±0.66) + 4 cylinders; LFQuad was 27 uniform axis-aligned boxes; `check_croco_skew.py`]. "Following
contour" = non-uniform boxes per region (width = actual body width there, narrowed at wheels
for wells) — NOT a convex hull of the body (engulfs it: VISUAL body reaches X±0.472,
over the wheel) and NOT decomposition into arbitrary hulls (inflate/bridge at fenders).
Box skew in the reference is invisible in-game (collision is not rendered) →
do not spend effort replicating it; do spend on functional aspects (clearance/radius/contact).

### Mass-safe collision edit: move points, do not regenerate

To open wheel-wells without disrupting physics: **move existing Geometry points**
(preserves per-point `#Mass#` → EXACT total mass + CoM); do NOT regenerate geometry (regenerating
redistributes mass → shifts CoM). [VERIFIED: reshape by moving points ±X maintained mass 1061.5 + CoM
(0,0.627,0.260) exact; a convex-hull regeneration shifted CoM 0.260→0.348].

### Contact diagnosis (isolates `contact=0` in ONE run)

Log `WheelHasContact(i)` per wheel + `WheelCountPresent()` for vehicle AND a working reference
(Croco) **side by side** in the test mission. `wc=0000` vs `wc=1111` isolates "wheels never
make contact". With `wp=0` (no wheel-item attached) the engine still simulates colliders from the model →
`wc` reflects the health of the model's wheel collision. Side-by-side delta (LFQuad −0.264 vs Croco
+0.216 at spawn) pinpointed placement immediately; "flies to 38 m" alone did not indicate it. API: `Car.Cast(o)`,
`WheelHasContact(int)`, `WheelCount()`, `WheelCountPresent()` — `scripts/3_game/vehicles/car.c:297,349,352`.

### Tension with item #5 (thickness ≥0.5 m)

Item #5 from 2026-05-30 checklist ("chassis component ≥0.5 m wide") **conflicts with wheel-wells**:
collision must be NARROW next to wheels to clear them. The ≥0.5 m applies to high-speed collision
of the main body; in the wheel zone, narrow is REQUIRED. Apply #5 to the body away from
wheels, not to wheel-well boxes.

## 2026-06-02 — Spawn-launch root cause CORRECTED (confirmed in-game, LFQuad)

The earlier "monolithic Geometry / low inertia -> spawn launch" hypothesis (2026-05-30, marked
[verify in-game]) is **refuted**. Confirmed cause of a vehicle that spawns underground and gets
ejected: a stray `#Mass#` tagg on a NON-Geometry LOD (typically FireGeometry 7e15).

- binarize bakes mass from whichever LOD carries `#Mass#`. A FireGeo `#Mass#` of all-zeros makes the
  ODOL ModelInfo `CoM=(0,0,0)`, inertia=0 -> `ECE_PLACE_ON_SURFACE` seats by CoM=0 -> spawns ~0.48 m low
  -> wheels buried -> PhysX depenetration -> ejection.
- The Geometry LOD (multi-component, convex, hubs) was correct the whole time. Proven by bisection:
  Croco-model + LFQuad-Geometry baked CoM 0.627; LFQuad-without-FireGeo baked 0.627. Material,
  mass-distribution, tris-vs-quads, skeleton and the py3d writer were all ruled out by experiment.
- `#Mass#` MUST live only on the Geometry LOD (1e13). py3d emits `#Mass#` on any LOD with a point whose
  `mass != None`. After every assemble, assert `lod.mass` per-LOD: only Geometry `!= None`, rest `None`.
  Fix: `point.mass=None` on non-Geometry LODs (see tools/fix_firegeo_mass.py).
- Placement depends on the baked CoM (`h ~= CoM.y - GeometryYmin`), NOT on Geometry-Ymin / LandContact /
  bbox. No geometry tweak fixes a CoM=0 spawn -- bake the mass first.
- Cross-refs preserved from the fork copy (LL-110 merge 2026-07-06): the Landrover/Bohemia build
  checklist (Addendum 2026-05-30) stays valid as BUILD invariants -- only the "monolith => spawn
  launch" diagnosis is invalidated. Mass-only-Geometry check: `dayz-p3d-audit` SKILL.md (#Mass# must
  live only on the Geometry LOD) + Killer #13. Cross-ref LL-079 (LOD bisection isolated the bug),
  LL-080, LL-081; handoff `30_Sessions/2026-06-02-LFQuad-placement-fix-firegeo-mass-CLOSED.md`.

## (added 2026-06-22) Audit an INHERITED / imported vehicle BEFORE planning

When receiving a vehicle from another author (config + model.cfg + p3d) or importing from another game, audit it
host-direct BEFORE committing a plan — reframes scope and is cheap. Origin: MercedesAMGLF
2026-06-22 (import of Mercedes-AMG GT3, v1 from a friend).

- **MLOD parse of the p3d (host-direct, ~60 Python lines)**: per LOD prints resolution + number of points/faces +
  named selections. Confirms which LODs / memory points / proxies ALREADY exist. A p3d "that looks complete"
  might truly be so (do not rebuild the structure) or have specific gaps (fix them one by one). Tell of
  a correct parse: final offset == file size, and resolutions match DayZ magic values
  (Geometry 1e13, Memory 1e15, ViewGeo 6e15, FireGeo 7e15). (Case: friend's p3d had 9 LODs + 50
  memory points + wheel/crew proxies → good TEMPLATE, not a sketch.)
- **Vertex audit of the SOURCE (glTF accessors / FBX) per mesh**: splitting into proxies is a problem of
  GROUPING meshes under the ceiling (~32768 resolved vertex-normals per LOD and per proxy), NOT of
  decimation. Sum `accessors[POSITION].count` per mesh and group them. (Case: 166 meshes / 236k verts; the
  largest 26.7k —no single one passes— but the aggregate blows through the ceiling ×7.)
- **Verify the SEMANTICS of inherited selections vs vanilla, not just their presence**: an inherited
  "complete" config can bring latent functional bugs. Compare each selection against how the vanilla
  engine consumes it:
  - `hiddenSelections`: vanilla uses FIXED light indices (CivilianSedan `dz\vehicles\wheeled\config.cpp:5123-5142`:
    front 0/1, brake 2/3, reverse 4/5, tail 6/7, dashboard 8). A config putting `color/glass/interior` into
    0-2 and lights behind DEVIATES → risk of broken lights.
  - refueling: vanilla loads position only if `MemoryPointExists("refill")` and `GetActionCompNameFuel()`
    returns `"refill"` (`scripts/3_game/vehicles/transport.c:75-76,313-315`). A p3d with `fuelpoint` (not
    `refill`) leaves the fuel action without position (falls back to 0,0,0).

## Addendum (2026-06-24) — proxy-path format + DayZ vehicle axis convention [VERIFICADO vs CivilianSedan + kt_roadkill]

> Two vehicle-general facts pinned during the SUB_BRZ Phase-3 structural pass. Apply to ANY DayZ vehicle,
> not just source-game imports.

### MLOD proxy selections carry NO `.p3d` extension

A proxy selection is `proxy:<path>.<NNN>` (3-digit index) where `<path>` has **no `.p3d` suffix** — the
engine appends `.p3d` when it resolves. VERIFIED on vanilla (`proxy:\dz\vehicles\wheeled\civiliansedan\
proxy\sedanwheel.001`) and on the shipped kt_roadkill mod (`proxy:kt_roadkill_scum\proxy\..._wheel.001`).
Writing `...sedanwheel.p3d.001` makes the engine look for `...sedanwheel.p3d.p3d` → **proxy not found → that
attachment/geometry silently missing in-game** (wheels don't simulate, body proxy chunks invisible). It is a
silent failure: offline editor/py3d checks still "see" the proxy selection. ALWAYS author proxy paths
without the extension. py3d `add_proxy(path, index, ...)` → pass `path` without `.p3d`.

### Pure-geometry body-proxy TRIANGLE FRAME — py3d "identity" != engine identity [VERIFIED in-game 2026-06-24, MercedesAMGLF AC1.4 PASS]

A pure-geometry proxy (body chunk / engine / interior / dash — 1 visual LOD, no config class) renders its
referenced geometry transformed by the frame the engine derives from the proxy TRIANGLE. MODEL-SPACE geometry +
the right triangle = the chunk overlays the shell exactly. Two traps, both bit MercedesAMGLF:

- **Geometry MODEL-SPACE, not centered.** Author each chunk at its real car position (vanilla `prox_int`
  Y[0.36,1.56] cabin, `sedan_engine` Z[-2.30,-1.12] front — measured by debinarizing the vanilla proxy `.p3d`).
  Re-centering each chunk to the origin makes the engine pile them all AT the origin.
- **Triangle frame MUST be `R=((-1,0,0),(0,0,1),(0,1,0))`, NOT py3d's "identity".** That is the value
  `py3d.derive_proxy_frame` returns for vanilla `prox_int`/`sedan_engine` AND kt_roadkill `_body`/`drivewheel`.
  py3d's `canonical_proxy_triangle(rotation=None)` ("identity") produces a triangle the ENGINE RENDERS
  ROTATED ~90 deg — it passed every offline check yet failed in-game twice. Author with:
  `lod.add_proxy(path, index, origin=(0,0,0), rotation=((-1,0,0),(0,0,1),(0,1,0)), scale=0.1)` (path WITHOUT `.p3d`).

GATE: for proxies the offline frame/render is NOT a valid acceptance gate (false-green twice on MercedesAMGLF) —
the gate is the in-game spawn+render; offline only rules out gross errors (missing selection, duplicate `.p3d`).
Attachment proxies (wheel/crew/door) are placed by physics/config, not the triangle — their `pos` is NOT a
reference for pure-geometry placement.

### DayZ vehicle axis convention: front = −z, driver = +x

Measured on CivilianSedan v54 (the CONTROL): headlights/engine/`drown_engine` at **z ≈ −1.7..−2.4** (front),
reverse light/exhaust/`refill` at **z ≈ +2.2..+2.6** (rear), `seat_driver` at **x = +0.436** (driver on
+x). So a DayZ car FACES −z. Wheel naming `wheel_<side>_<axle>`: side 1 = +x, side 2 = −x; axle 1 = front
(−z), axle 2 = rear (+z) — front (steered) wheels are `_X_1`. When importing from a tool whose cars face +z
(source-game, most), the correct transform flips z; a car that "looks rotated 180°" relative to the source is
usually CORRECT — verify against CivilianSedan markers (a static render cannot show a front/back swap), do not
refactor on sight.

### `validate()` ERR_COMPONENT_NAMING is a false-positive for vehicles

Vanilla vehicle Geometry LODs use **lowercase `component01`** (CivilianSedan does, and it works) — the
py3d/audit "engine requires `Component01` uppercase" rule does not hold for Inventory_Base items either:
measured in game on 2026-10-02, `component01` collides exactly like `Component01` on an item and on a
`HouseNoDestruct`, unbinarized and binarized, and binarize writes both as `component01` (dayz-p3d-audit
killer #2). Match vanilla (lowercase) for vehicles; the resulting `ERR_COMPONENT_NAMING` from `P3D.validate()`
up to py3d 1.8.0, the pinned wheel, is expected (the CONTROL itself triggers it); py3d 1.9.0 does not check
the case and stays silent. The same code for a collision LOD with faces and no component at all is not one
to wave off: on an item and a building that collision was gone (vehicles not measured); from 1.9.0 it is
the only reason the code fires, on the Geometry, View or Fire LOD.
*(Corrected 2026-10-02: the first sentence ended "rule is for Inventory_Base items.")*

## Addendum (2026-06-24 s7) — componentNN DUAL-TAG: hub/seat selections must SHARE faces with a componentNN [VERIFIED in-game, was the SUB_BRZ spawn blocker]

The LOD tables above list `componentNN` + `wheel_X_Y_damper_land` + `seat_driver`/`seat_codriver` as if they were
independent selections. They are NOT independent: **the engine enumerates collision/action components ONLY by
`componentNN`**, so a hub/seat selection whose faces are in NO `componentNN` (a standalone island) is invisible to
the component pass and entity creation FAILS:
- `PHYSICS (E): Won't simulate, wheel wheel_1_1_damper_land has no proper selection in geometry`
- `PHYSICS (E): Action selection 'seat_driver' was not found in view or fire geometry level of model when parsing class Crew::Crew`

REQUIREMENT (Bohemia wiki "Object must be named ComponentXX"): each hub/seat box carries BOTH names on the SAME
faces — `wheel_X_Y_damper_land` AND a `componentNN` (Geometry); `seat_driver`/`seat_codriver` AND a `componentNN`
(ViewGeo, plus Geometry if seats live there). The hub IS component0N; the seat IS component0M. This is the SAME
dual-tag a FireGeo already does for `dmgzone_*` + `componentNN` on one box — extend it to the Geometry hubs and the
ViewGeo/Geometry seats.

THE DISCRIMINATOR (add to verify_<mod>.py): for each hub/seat selection, the % of its faces also covered by a
`componentNN` in the same LOD. Working cars = **100%** (CivilianSedan 15/15, kt_roadkill 15/15, LFQuad 60/60); the
SUB_BRZ that would NOT spawn = **0/12**. 100% = pass; anything else = the spawn blocker.
```python
def component_overlap(lod, sel_name):  # returns 1.0 when ok
    comp = {tuple(sorted(v.point_index for v in f.vertices))
            for n in lod.selections if n.lower().startswith("component")
            for f in lod.selections[n].faces}
    tf = [tuple(sorted(v.point_index for v in f.vertices)) for f in lod.selections[sel_name].faces]
    return sum(k in comp for k in tf) / len(tf)
```
Why it survives many "the selection is present and parity-correct" cycles: everyone checks PRESENCE; nobody checks
the componentNN face-OVERLAP. Offline parity ≠ drivable — this is one more thing only the in-game spawn gate (or
this overlap check) catches. The s2 candidate deltas (hub 16pt-vs-8pt-box, seats-in-Geometry) were RED HERRINGS:
a box hub is a valid component, seats-in-Geometry is fine (LFQuad does it) — once they are ALSO componentNN.

## Addendum (2026-06-25) — ATTACHMENT proxy needs a companion BONE-NAME selection (py3d add_proxy omits it) [VERIFIED vs CivilianSedan + kt_roadkill; in-game test PENDING]

An **attachment** proxy (crew / wheel / door — i.e. one the engine binds to a skeleton bone, NOT a pure-geometry
body chunk) needs TWO things in the LOD, not one:
1. the `proxy:<path>.<NNN>` selection + triangle (what `py3d LOD.add_proxy` creates), AND
2. a **companion NAMED SELECTION whose name IS the bone name** (`crewdriver`, `crewcodriver`, `wheel_1_1`,
   `wheel_2_1`, `wheel_1_2`, `wheel_2_2`, `doors_driver`, `doors_codriver`, `radiator`, …), carrying the **SAME
   3 points + 1 face** as the proxy. This is the proxy→bone binding Object Builder writes when you "name" a proxy.

`py3d add_proxy` creates only (1). Without (2) the engine reports, at `Load entity type`:
- `PHYSICS (E): Proxy with bone name 'crewdriver'/'crewcodriver' was not found in view geometry level of model`
  → crew not set up → `CrewPositionIndex` returns -1 → **get-in action never appears** (the cursor hits the seat
  component but the crew position isn't registered).
- `PHYSICS (W): Proxy with name 'CivSedanWheel_1_1'..'2_2' was not found in FireGeometry of the shape` (the wheel
  attachment can't find its hub proxy).

**Pure-geometry body-chunk proxies do NOT need (2)** (no bone) — that is why they resolve with zero error while the
crew/wheel proxies fail; do not be misled into thinking py3d proxies are universally broken.

VERIFIED — both working models bind every attachment proxy this way, in **ViewGeo AND FireGeo**:
```
# CivilianSedan & kt_roadkill ViewGeo+FireGeo non-proxy selections that share points with a proxy:
crewdriver   -> crew_driver.001    crewcodriver -> crew_cargo.001
wheel_1_1 -> sedanwheel.003  wheel_1_2 -> sedanwheel.004  wheel_2_1 -> sedanwheel.001  wheel_2_2 -> sedanwheel.002
doors_driver -> sedandoors_driver.001   doors_codriver -> sedandoors_codriver.001   radiator -> radiator_car.001
```
The wheel **bone name maps by POSITION** (`wheel_<side>_<axle>`, side1=+x/2=−x, axle1=front=−z/2=rear=+z), NOT by the
proxy index. The bone names must also exist in `model.cfg` `CfgSkeletons skeletonBones[]` (SUB_BRZ already declares
`crewdriver`/`crewcodriver`/`wheel_*`).

DISCRIMINATOR / verifier (add to `verify_<mod>.py`): for each attachment proxy, assert a same-points companion
selection named after its bone exists. SUB_BRZ had **0** bone selections (only the 4 occlusion components + 2 seats);
CivilianSedan/kt have the full set. Builder: `rip_p3_structural.py` must, after each crew/wheel `add_proxy`, create
the bone selection (see `<vehicle-import>\tools\patch_proxyframes_crew.py` `_ap`, 2026-06-25: `add_proxy(rotation=R,
scale=1.0)` + point-flags 63 + bone selection from the proxy's faces/points).

GATE: as with every proxy finding here, offline checks gave FALSE-GREEN 4 times on SUB_BRZ (occlusion / frame / scale
/ flags) — the only valid gate is the in-game RPT (the `bone name not found` line gone). This bone-selection fix is
**CONFIRMED in-game on SUB_BRZ (2026-06-25, s8)**: re-spawn via dayz-mcp → server RPT has ZERO `PHYSICS (E/W)` lines
(all `bone name not found` / `no proper selection` gone). BUT this only fixes get-in **gate-1** (`CrewPositionIndex`);
**gate-2 (`CrewCanGetThrough`) needs the car to run as an Enforce Script CLASS, not bare `CarScript`** — a ripped racing-game car
config `class <MOD>: CarScript` with no `.c` runs as bare CarScript whose `CrewCanGetThrough` returns false (base
`Transport` stub) → get-in still never appears. See `rip-import.md` s8 addendum "GET-IN ROOT CAUSE #2".

**Separate, do not conflate with get-in:** (a) the user insists DOORS must open/close first or get-in won't show —
investigate `CarScript.CrewCanGetThrough`/`IsAreaAtDoorFree` + whether get-in needs CarDoor **attachments** (SUB_BRZ
has none; doors are baked into body chunks). (b) get-in's `CanReachSeatFromDoors` (`carscript.c:2710`) uses the
`seat_con_X_Y` **memory point** + player within 1.0 m, NOT the physical door attachment.

## Addendum (2026-06-25) — GET-IN ROOT CAUSE #2: a custom CarScript vehicle needs an Enforce Script CLASS, not just geometry [VERIFIED in-game on SUB_BRZ 2026-06-25 + vs vanilla/FC source]

> Project-agnostic. Applies to ANY DayZ ground vehicle declared `class <MOD>: CarScript` with no `.c` script
> class — source-game/OBJ/Blender imports, cars/trucks/quads authored from scratch. This is the get-in blocker that
> survives a perfectly parity-correct model (every LOD, every selection, every memory point present). The two
> proxy-side gotchas above (componentNN DUAL-TAG, ATTACHMENT proxy BONE-NAME) fix gate-1 of get-in; THIS fixes
> gate-2 and is independent of geometry. **MERCEDES_AMGLF will hit this same wall** — at this date its
> `MERCEDES_AMGLF_Base.c` overrides only vitals + `OnDebugSpawn` (0 of the 3 required overrides).

### Symptom

The vehicle spawns, renders and collides, but the "Get in" / Entrar action NEVER appears in the action menu.
No RPT error by itself (the action is silently filtered inside its `ActionCondition`). Telemetry tell: the
reported `class_name` stays at the base `"CarScript"` instead of your `"<MOD>_Base"` — the override class never
attached because there is no script module compiling it.

### Cause — the two-gate ActionCondition + the unoverridden base stub

`ActionGetInTransport.ActionCondition`
(`scripts/4_world/classes/useractionscomponent/actions/interact/actiongetintransport.c:51-66`) has TWO gates
that BOTH must pass:
1. gate-1 `CrewPositionIndex(componentIndex) >= 0` — needs the crew proxy bone selection (the "ATTACHMENT proxy
   BONE-NAME" addendum above); and
2. gate-2 `trans.CrewCanGetThrough(crew_index)` (~:63), then a reachability loop
   `CanReachSeatFromDoors(selections[i], player.GetPosition(), 1.0)` (:71-77).

`CrewCanGetThrough` is **NOT overridden by `CarScript` or `Car`** — only by the concrete vanilla car classes
(`CivilianSedan` etc.). A vehicle running as **bare `CarScript`** falls to the base stub
`Transport.CrewCanGetThrough` (`scripts/3_game/vehicles/transport.c:493-500`), which returns **false** in the
normal build (`#ifndef CFGMODS_DEFINE_TEST`) → gate-2 false → get-in never appears, no matter how perfect the
crew bone is. The same trap hits `GetSeatAnimationType` (`transport.c:475-479` → `Error("not implemented")`) and
`GetAnimInstance` (used in `ActionGetInTransport.Start`), both of which also `Error()`/false in the base.

### Fix — ship a thin `<MOD>_Base.c` script class (PIPELINE requirement; for an import pipeline add to the config/script phase)

Minimal M1 set (the three are mandatory; door mappers / `CanReach*` / `GetSeatIndexFromDoor` /
`GetAnimSourceFromSelection` are M2 — needed for openable doors and seat-switching, not for entering+driving).
Signatures verbatim from `CivilianSedan` (`scripts/4_world/.../civiliansedan.c:85,95`):

```c
class <PREFIX>_Base extends CarScript
{
    override int GetAnimInstance()                 { return VehicleAnimInstances.SEDAN; }       // civiliansedan.c:85
    override int GetSeatAnimationType(int posIdx)                                               // civiliansedan.c:95
    {
        switch (posIdx) { case 0: return DayZPlayerConstants.VEHICLESEAT_DRIVER;
                          case 1: return DayZPlayerConstants.VEHICLESEAT_CODRIVER; }            // add PASSENGER_* per seat
        return 0;
    }
    override bool CrewCanGetThrough(int posIdx)    { return posIdx == 0 || posIdx == 1; }       // M1 ungated; gate on door-state at M2
    // MODEL must carry memory points seat_con_1_1 / seat_con_2_1 + a crew config with seat_driver / seat_codriver.
    // M2 (openable doors / seat-switch): GetCarDoorsState, door-slot mappers, CanReach*, GetSeatIndexFromDoor, GetAnimSourceFromSelection.
}
```

The mod needs a `CfgMods` script module (`worldScriptModule files[]`) so the `.c` compiles. Pattern confirmed on
the shipped community mod **FC ("Frontera Cars")**: `FC_*_Base extends CarScript` directly (config
`class FC_Vaz_2101: CarScript`, FC_Options/.../FC_Vaz_2101/config.cpp:514) — FC cars do NOT re-parent to a vanilla
car; they override `CrewCanGetThrough`/`GetSeatAnimationType`/`GetAnimInstance` + the M2 door methods themselves.

### Geometry requirement (verified) — `seat_con_*` memory points

`CarScript.CanReachSeatFromDoors` (`scripts/.../carscript.c:2710-2731`) calls
`GetDoorConditionPointFromSelection` → `if (MemoryPointExists(conPointName))` and only then compares distance
≤ 1.0; if the memory point is absent it returns false → action filtered. The base maps `seat_driver`→`seat_con_1_1`,
`seat_codriver`→`seat_con_2_1` (`carscript.c:2674`), so NO override is needed for the mapping, but the model MUST
carry the memory points `seat_con_1_1`/`seat_con_2_1`, positioned so the player is ≤ 1.0 m away when facing the
door/seat. The `crew` config must expose `seat_driver`/`seat_codriver`.

LHD-only caveat (SP-426, added 2026-10-01, WRX STI B-01): [EXACT] "no override is needed" holds for
a LEFT-HAND-DRIVE layout only. On a right-hand-drive car whose memory points are named by physical
side (driver door = `seat_con_2_1`), the base table pairs each seat with the far door and get-in
dies on the 1.0 m test from the correct door; override `GetDoorConditionPointFromSelection` crossing
the sides, as vanilla does for its own layouts (`OffroadHatchback.c:364-379`, `Van_01.c:269-287`,
DayZ 1.30.164014 Exp).

### Doors are NOT required for get-in

`GetCarDoorsState` returns `DOORS_MISSING` when no `CarDoor` attachment exists (`civiliansedan.c:178-181`,
FC unknown_40493.c:982-985), and `DOORS_MISSING != DOORS_CLOSED` → `CrewCanGetThrough` passes. A script class with
NO door attachments gives WORKING get-in (baked doors stay static). Openable doors are a SEPARATE feature (`CarDoor`
classes + door proxies + door `.p3d` + `AnimationSources DoorsX` + model.cfg door bones), exactly as FC ships
(FC_Vaz_2101 `class FC_Vaz_2101_Door_Driver: CarDoor`, config.cpp:326; `AnimationSources class DoorsDriver` :843).

### In-game tell after the fix

Telemetry reports the custom class (`class_name:"<MOD>_Base"` instead of `"CarScript"`) AND "Get in" appears.
As with every finding here, offline checks cannot prove get-in — the gate is in-game.

## Addendum (2026-06-25) — verification = validate against the CONTROL, not assert blind; damper/steering are NOT universal [VERIFIED vs CivilianSedan MLOD]

A verifier whose expected values are hardcoded (even when comments cite "sedan") is a false-green
risk: it asserts the producer's internal consistency, not the engine contract. Fix = a **positive
control**: run the UNIVERSAL subset of checks against a known-good vanilla car (`CivilianSedan`
debinarized MLOD) and require it to PASS. If the sedan fails a "universal" check, the contract is
wrong, not the car. Tool: `<vehicle-import>\tools\verify_rip_car.py --positive-control <sedan_mlod.p3d>`.

What the positive control CAUGHT and corrected — both `verify_amglf.py` and `verify_brz.py` had it:
- They asserted `wheel_X_Y_damper` / `wheel_X_Y_damper_axis` and `wheel_X_1_steering` / `_steering_axis`
  as **Memory-LOD universal** selections. **The vanilla sedan has NONE of them in Memory.** It uses a
  `susp_arm_*` linkage (double-wishbone) with `susp_arm_steering_X_1_axis` for steering, and keeps
  `wheel_X_Y_damper_land` in the **Geometry** LOD (the hub), not Memory. The simple
  `wheel_X_Y_damper`/`wheel_X_1_steering` scheme is a friend/import convention, NOT vanilla contract.
- TRUE universal wheel contract (sedan-verified): `wheel_X_Y_axis` in Memory + `wheel_X_Y_damper_land`
  in Geometry, each 100% inside a `componentNN` (see the componentNN dual-tag addendum). Damper/steering
  selection NAMES are per-car/per-skeleton (model.cfg) → POLICY tier, not universal.
- ACTION for the Mercedes project: reclassify those two checks in `verify_amglf.py` (they pass today
  only because the friend body carries them, not because they are contract).

Run-before-closed gates (block, don't skip): `verify_rip_car.py --self-test` (non-tautology proof,
catches the 0/12-componentNN blocker), `--positive-control <sedan>` (contract satisfiable),
target hard-pass, `roundtrip_writer.py` (py3d write fidelity). Never close a phase on a metric that is
0.000/100% by construction (R22 tell).

## Addendum (2026-06-25b) — reusable verification harness for ANY car (generic vs rip-specific split)

The rip→DayZ build grew a verification harness in `<vehicle-import>\tools\`. The GENERIC pieces apply to ANY DayZ
vehicle (procedural / OBJ / glTF too), the rest are PATTERNS to re-point. Use them as run-before-closed gates
that BLOCK, not optional steps — skippable verification is how the offline false-green happened. All green
offline 2026-06-25; build-time wiring is HELD until the SUB_BRZ script-class Cowork session closes.

GENERIC (wire these for any car, not just a rip):
- **the universal car verifier** (lives in the import project's tools, not shipped here) — tier-**U**
  universal engine contract + per-car `POLICY` dict (dmgzone list,
  body-proxy naming, mod token). `--positive-control <CivilianSedan_mlod.p3d>` proves the contract is
  satisfiable; `--self-test` proves non-vacuity. Add a POLICY entry per new car instead of forking a
  `verify_<mod>.py` (the per-car `verify_amglf.py`/`verify_brz.py` are superseded).
- `visual_gate.py <p3d> <out_dir>` — Blender-headless N-angle render + `blender-visual-review` checklist +
  unresolved-proxy inventory. CAVEAT (s20 2026-07-02): it does NOT reproduce the engine cull — the engine
  renders the ANTI-cross side and shades with the STORED MLOD normals, while Blender no-normals + backface
  culling shows the +cross side (the exact opposite); and it does NOT resolve body-split proxy chunks
  (they are inventoried, not rendered). Use it only for geometry presence / silhouette / proxy inventory;
  winding and see-through verdicts are IN-GAME ONLY. Works on any `.p3d`. Needs Blender 5.1 (`BLENDER` env).
- `roundtrip_writer.py` — py3d read→save→read fidelity (the LFInfectedBig skinned-export corruption class).
- `_harness_util.py:clean_visual_shell` — reconstruct a runnable shell-only `.p3d` from a deployed full one.

PATTERN (bound to a builder/transform — re-point for a non-rip car):
- STRUCTURAL BISECTION (`roundtrip_structural.py`): feed YOUR structural builder the CONTROL (CivilianSedan
  shell + locators from its own memory points) and require the regenerated LODs to pass the UNIVERSAL subset.
  Run a NEGATIVE control too (break the invariant — e.g. disable the hub/seat componentNN dual-tag) and require
  the bisection to CATCH it: that proves it tests the BUILDER and is non-tautological (would have caught the s7
  0/12 blocker offline). Requires the builder exposed as `build_structural(profile)` (parametrized shell /
  locators / mass / bbox-source / out), not a hardcoded script.
- TRANSFORM FIT (`fit_transform.py`): fit the source→DayZ transform from anchor pairs, confirm it is a pure
  sign-flip+offset, and PERTURB it (wrong sign / offset / scale) to prove the residual discriminates — a
  self-built pair gives residual 0.000 by construction (R22 tell), so the discrimination test is what makes it
  real, not the residual.

Rip-specific implementation + the MANDATORY-gates spec: `rip-import.md` §"Generalized harness".

> Origen: rip→DayZ verification-harness session 2026-06-25 (`<vehicle-import>\tools\`; HARNESS_HANDOFF.md). Closes
> the verifier-only gap: the harness now also bisects the BUILDER and rule-fits the transform, both proven

## Addendum (2026-06-27) — Crew get-in: dedicated seat components + canonical crew-proxy triangle [VERIFICADO in-game: LFQuad D34 + MercedesAMGLF]

The "Get in" radial and the seated player are governed by TWO ViewGeometry structures that procedural / regen body pipelines get wrong by default. Both blocked LFQuad (~7 days, resolved 2026-06-05 "Bloque A — Crew" D34) and MercedesAMGLF (2026-06-27). Symptom: the driver works but the **codriver radial never appears**, and the seated player sits sideways/backward or mis-placed.

### 1. Get-in appears for driver but NOT codriver (raycast "always driver")

DayZ resolves the seat with **`Transport.CrewPositionIndex(componentIdx)`** (proto native, `P:\scripts\3_game\vehicles\transport.c:116`) over the **collision component the cursor raycast HITS in the ViewGeometry LOD** (`ObjIntersectView`, `dayzphysics.c:88`; consumed at `actiongetintransport.c:50-51`) — NOT by memory-point proximity. So each seat needs its OWN dedicated, clean, closed-convex component:

- `seat_driver` = 1 dedicated `ComponentNN` (its own cube); `seat_codriver` = 1 dedicated `ComponentNN`. Dual-tag: the seat selection and its `ComponentNN` share the SAME faces (100% overlap).
- Seats painted across a multi-component grid -> the raycast never lands cleanly on the 2nd seat -> "always driver". (LFQuad N1.5: `seat_driver/codriver` spread over 88/112 points across ~23 components -> codriver never appeared.)
- References: vanilla CivilianSedan `seat_driver`=component31 / `seat_codriver`=component32 (one each); Croco one each.
- **FIX (LFQuad + Mercedes):** replace with 2 dedicated seat-cube components — each a clean closed box (8 verts, 12 tris, ALL faces outward) tagged `seat_X` + its own `ComponentNN` on the same faces.

Closed-car note (Mercedes): a closed car does NOT need the full body shell in ViewGeo — 2 dedicated seat cubes + wheel/crew proxies suffice. A solid body box (e.g. a central "spine") only OCCLUDES the seat cubes (cursor hits the spine first -> no seat hit) -> remove it. LFQuad/vanilla keep a shell only because they are open / have window openings.

### 2. Seated player sideways/backward/mis-placed, and proxy translations "don't move" him

Seated position AND orientation come from the **crew-proxy triangle** (`crewdriver`/`crewcodriver`, present in ViewGeo AND FireGeo), NOT from `pos_driver`/`pos_codriver` memory points. Two traps:

- **Triangle SHAPE must be CANONICAL = 3 distinct angles.** `origin + e1 + e2` with edge lengths ~1.0 and ~2.0 (angles 90 / 63.4 / 26.6). An isosceles 90/45/45 triangle = AMBIGUOUS frame (the proxy angle-sort rule ties -> orientation rotates differently per seat). A TINY triangle (py3d `add_proxy(scale=0.1)` -> edges ~0.05) is below the engine's frame-derivation threshold -> player mis-placed AND **translating the proxy has little/no visible effect** (the "I moved it and nothing happened" symptom on MercedesAMGLF). Make it canonical and translations respond.
- **FRAME (facing) depends on e1/e2 AND the model's base orientation.** Model facing -z (vanilla convention) -> SUB/vanilla use `e1=(0,0,1), e2=(0,2,0)` -> `R=((-1,0,0),(0,0,1),(0,1,0))`. A model yaw-rotated 180 deg (e.g. a source-game import reoriented in a later phase, like MercedesAMGLF) needs `e1=(0,0,-1)` -> `R=((1,0,0),(0,0,-1),(0,1,0))` to face forward. Replicate a KNOWN-GOOD same-orientation reference; do NOT copy a frame cross-model without recomputing. Practical tell: with the canonical triangle, +z moved the Mercedes player FORWARD (its forward is -z after the 180 deg yaw) — establish the sign empirically once, then it is exact.
- **The triangle ORIGIN (v0) anchor sets the seated HEIGHT + longitudinal position** — not the memory point. Translate all 3 verts together; use ~15 cm steps (small steps read as "no change"). A low sports-car roof may clip the standing pose regardless (inherent; not fixable from the .p3d).

### Builder fix (so future cars never hit this)
source-game/regen builders create crew proxies via `add_proxy(..., scale=0.1)` -> tiny ambiguous triangles, and may paint seats over the collision grid. Change crew-proxy creation to emit the **canonical triangle (edges ~1.0/2.0, 3 distinct angles)** with the model-correct frame, in BOTH ViewGeo and FireGeo, and build seats as **2 dedicated clean cubes** (one ComponentNN each) from the start.

> Origen: LFQuad "Bloque A — Crew" D34 (`30_Sessions/2026-06-05-LFQuad-crew-resuelto-postura.md`, in-game confirmed) + MercedesAMGLF get-in/seated-pose (2026-06-27). Cross-ref: `CrewPositionIndex` transport.c:116, `ActionGetInTransport.ActionCondition` actiongetintransport.c:50-73, `CanReachSeatFromDoors` carscript.c:2710. The earlier "codriver needs crew proxies in FireGeo" diagnosis was REFUTED — the cause is collision-component cleanliness + canonical proxy, not FireGeo presence.

### CRITICAL EXTENSION (2026-06-28, SUB_BRZ — in-game CONFIRMED): seat ComponentNN cubes must be INWARD-wound + point flags `0x0000003F` (SP-130), or they are NOT raycast-collidable

The "2 dedicated clean cubes, all faces outward" rule above is NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT for a py3d-authored vehicle. A seat cube with **OUTWARD winding + point flags 0** is **invisible to `DayZPhysics.RaycastRV(..., ObjIntersectView)`** — the get-in action-target raycast never resolves it, so `CrewPositionIndex` falls back to component0 and the **codriver radial never appears** (the driver "works" only by that fallback; even the driver cube isn't truly hit). The crew mapping `CrewPositionIndex(comp)->crewIdx` is already correct (comp0→driver, comp1→codriver) — irrelevant while the geometry isn't raycast-collidable.

Measured (SUB_BRZ vs LFQuad positive control, headless probe): BRZ seat cubes were OUTWARD + flags 0 → `RaycastRV` `hit=0` from every direction at the exact cube center. After rebuilding the BRZ ViewGeo seat ComponentNN with **inward winding + point flags copied from the control** (not just shape/name), `RaycastRV` returns `hit=1 comp=1 crewIdx=1` and the codriver get-in works **in-game (confirmed 2026-06-28)**. The flag value to copy is `0x0000003F` (SP-130): sealed control `civiliansedan_mlod.p3d` SHA `823585B6EC9727F70C3ABCAD309ECBF7E87DBA1E66FA14A1ECAB9AB1FCA921DD`, ViewGeometry (res 6e15), 478 points / 422 faces, histogram `0x0000003F` → 478 points (100,0 %), `0x02000000` → 0 points. The s9 patch changed winding and flags together and never isolated the flag as cause; the safe rule is the sealed vanilla convention. Corroborated on a second vanilla model: `quadbike_mlod.p3d` carries `0x0000003F` on 482 of 482 ViewGeometry points. The `0x02000000` that earlier notes recorded as the requirement is what OUR OWN exporter emits — 290 of 296 points on `LFQuad_body_lights.p3d` — so the note that wrote it down had measured the product, not the control.

**Rule:** build ViewGeometry collision ComponentNN for vehicles (seats, and any cursor/action-targetable component) by COPYING the sealed vanilla control's convention — **inward winding + point flags `0x0000003F` (SP-130)** — not py3d's default outward+flags0. The original s9 patch changed winding and flags at once, so the flag was never isolated as the cause. Outward py3d boxes pass every offline shape/winding/dual-tag check yet are NOT raycast-collidable. Dual-tag and the in-game confirmations stand: SUB_BRZ s9 and MercedesAMGLF s12 headless `hit=1 comp=6 crewIdx=1`.

**Diagnostic (reusable, no manual aim):** a headless mission probe that spawns the car + a known-good control, dumps `CrewPositionIndex(0..79)`, and casts `DayZPhysics.RaycastRV` (FIRE+VIEW) at each seat — localizes "mapping vs raycast vs collidability" in one run. Pattern files: `brz_crew_probe_init.c` + `brz-crew-probe-run.ps1` (SUB_BRZ 2026-06-28). Parse the raw `hit=1 comp=N crewIdx=N` lines, NOT a boolean verdict — a regex `-match '1'` also matches `-1` (false-green observed this session).

> Origen: SUB_BRZ codriver get-in, root cause confirmed in-game 2026-06-28 (Claude diagnosis via headless crew-probe + Codex implementation). Applies to ALL rip/py3d-built vehicle ViewGeo; same fix pending on MercedesAMGLF.

### MercedesAMGLF CONFIRMATION + refinements (2026-06-28 s12) — the seat winding+flags fix CONFIRMED on a 2nd car

The CRITICAL EXTENSION above is now CONFIRMED on MercedesAMGLF (headless crew-probe: codriver VIEW ray from its door side -> `hit=1 comp=6 crewIdx=1`; driver -> `hit=1 comp=5 crewIdx=0`). Three refinements from applying it to a CLOSED car (cite: MERCEDES s11/s12 + LFQuad D34 + SUB_BRZ s9):

- **Apply it MINIMALLY when the seat ComponentNN already map.** If the ViewGeo seats already enumerate as their own ComponentNN with the correct crew mapping (verify with the get-in diag PROBE / crew-probe `CrewPositionIndex(comp)`), do NOT rebuild the whole ViewGeo (SUB_BRZ rebuilt all ~23 components). Flip ONLY the seat ComponentNN faces in-place to inward winding + set their point flags to `0x0000003F`, recomputing each face normal from the new (inward) order. This preserves the verified component indices/positions and the seat<->componentNN dual-tag. Mercedes: only `seat_driver`=Component06 / `seat_codriver`=Component07 changed; body components left untouched; `verify_amglf.py` stayed 35/35.

- **"Body shell in ViewGeo / high-index seats" is a RED HERRING for the codriver blocker.** MercedesAMGLF s11 added 5 body occlusion components + moved seats to high indices (idx 5/6) on the theory that the engine "could not discriminate 2 bare cubes" -> the codriver STILL failed. The real and ONLY cause was winding+flags (proven s12). Confirms + sharpens the 2026-06-27 closed-car note: a closed car needs NEITHER a body shell NOR high-index seat placement in ViewGeo -- just the 2 seat cubes, inward-wound + point-flagged. Leave any body occlusion components OUTWARD + flags 0 (inert, non-raycast-collidable -> cannot occlude the seat ray). Do not chase the "give the ViewGeo a body" lever; chase winding+flags.

- **Crew-probe seat anchor: aim at `pos_driver`/`pos_codriver` memory points (engine space) -- but ONLY if they sit inside the seat cube.** `c.GetMemoryPointPos("pos_driver")` returns ENGINE-space coords, sidestepping the py3d->engine sign flip (Mercedes engine driver = +x, py3d driver = -x). Mercedes pos_driver/codriver are y~0.78, INSIDE the seat cubes -> aim there directly (no height-raise). CAVEAT for the positive control: a VANILLA car's `pos_driver` is the door-sill ENTRY point (CivilianSedan: y~0.07, x~+-1.4), NOT the seat center -> a ray aimed there hits the body (comp=-1), giving a FALSE "control failed". For a positive control, anchor at the seat ComponentNN centroid, or use a car whose `pos_X` is at the seat (LFQuad). The target's result is self-validating when its rays hit the real seat comps.

- **Mercedes crew-probe tooling** (reusable, no manual aim): `mercedes_crew_probe_init.c` (spawns target + control near player; DumpTable `CrewPositionIndex` + RaycastRV VIEW+FIRE per seat from +-x/+-z) + `mercedes-crew-probe-run.ps1` (injects the probe into the PROJECT-LOCAL `<Mod>_dev\_server\mpmissions\...\init.c` -- NOT the shared DayZServer mission; launches detached, polls the server `script.log` for `[CREW-PROBE]`, restores the original init.c in `finally`). Parse the raw `hit=N comp=N crewIdx=N` integers, never a regex `-match '1'` (it also matches `-1`). Build-only PBO for the probe: `dayz-test.ps1 -Build` ALWAYS launches (no build-only flag) -> replicate its AddonBuilder call directly (`<src> <target> -prefix=<Mod> -temp=<FRESH_DIR> -packonly`); a FRESH `-temp` gives a clean sync AND dodges the sandbox `Remove-Item` guard (false-positives when `C:\Program` appears in the same command).

> Origen: MERCEDES_AMGLF s12 (2026-06-28, copiloto get-in confirmed headless via crew-probe). Applies the SUB_BRZ CRITICAL EXTENSION to a closed car; corrects the s11 "give the ViewGeo a body / high-index seats" theory (red herring). Cross-ref MERCEDES_AMGLF_dev\HANDOFF.md s12.

## REGEN-FROM-glTF BODY + PROXY-SPLIT (added 2026-06-24)

Regenerating a high-poly body from a glTF/FBX and splitting it into proxies to beat the 65535
resolved-vertex ceiling (the MercedesAMGLF GT3 path) has two traps that pass every offline gate and
only surface in-game. Origin: MercedesAMGLF Fase 2 smoke, 2026-06-24.

### glTF→DayZ winding: the offline check can be a tautology
The transform `DayZ=(-s·bx,+s·bz,-s·by)` has `det=-1` (a mirror) and flips face handedness. A winding
check that compares the post-transform geometric normal against the post-transform **declared glTF
normals** is **tautological** — the winding was reversed precisely to make them agree, so it reports
~0.00% flipped by construction (the R22 "0.000" tell). It proves internal consistency, not that DayZ
renders the texture outward. DayZ backface-culls by **winding**; the mirror-compensating reverse left
the front face pointing inward, so the body rendered see-through (texture on the interior) in-game.
Fix confirmed in-game: do NOT reverse — keep the glTF vertex order (`reverse_winding=False`). The
offline winding check must validate against the DayZ convention or against a reference model known to
render correctly, never against the normals you picked to match.

### proxy placement: an identity frame does not mean the geometry is aligned
A proxy `proxy:\...\X.p3d.NNN` is a tiny triangle whose engine-derived frame (angle-sort, computed by
`py3d.derive_proxy_frame` = the engine's rule per `dayz-proxy-align`) can be **identity-perfect**
(det +1, unambiguous, angles 90/63.4/26.6) and the referenced geometry still render ~2.5 m offset. The
frame is not the whole story: the engine places the referenced model by a **non-origin reference
point**, so a vanilla wheel (local geometry centered at its own origin, ~0.4 m, full LOD set) lands
right while a body region in **model-space** (car-sized, single visual LOD) is shifted by roughly its
own extent. Two fixes that FAILED on MercedesAMGLF: bumping the proxy-triangle scale (the engine
normalizes the triangle, so scale is moot) and the "wheel pattern" (re-center the geometry to its
bbox-center + anchor at that center — proves the engine does not use bbox-center either).

Practical guidance: **vanilla does not proxy the car body** — the body is direct geometry under the
65535 ceiling. Prefer fitting the body under 65535 (decimate with `blender-visual-review`, or split
into ≤2 sub-objects of direct geometry) over body-proxys of large model-space geometry. If you must
proxy large geometry, the referenced `.p3d` likely has to be LOCAL-centered with the same LOD set as a
vanilla wheel (Geometry/Memory/ViewGeo/FireGeo), and the placement reference must be reverse-engineered
with a controlled in-game anchor-sweep — never assume identity-frame == aligned. Status on
MercedesAMGLF: winding CLOSED, proxy placement OPEN (defect #2); see `MERCEDES_AMGLF_dev\HANDOFF.md`.
Same risk is live on SUB_BRZ (source-game import, all-proxy body) — this finding applies there too.

### proxy placement — s2 model-space convention NOT confirmed; in-game FAIL (s3 2026-06-24)
> **⚠️ CORRECTION (s3 2026-06-24, in-game smoke):** the "RESOLVED" claim below FAILED the in-game gate — body proxies
> rendered rotated/invisible (user's eye). The model-space + identity-frame convention IS identity in py3d
> (`derive_proxy_frame` = exact identity for all 6 `mb_`) but did NOT align in-game, and the offline gate (frame=identity
> + scatter render + verifier 33/33) gave **FALSE-GREEN twice**. **The leading root cause is orthogonal to the
> geometry-space convention:** the proxy SELECTION PATH carried a `.p3d` extension (`proxy:...\mb_chassis.p3d.001`) →
> the engine appends `.p3d` and looks for `mb_chassis.p3d.p3d` → proxy not found → geometry silently missing in-game
> (offline py3d still "sees" the selection). See the `.p3d`-extension rule in `references/vehicle-structural-parity.md`
> (VERIFIED vs vanilla CivilianSedan + kt_roadkill). **FIX THE PATH FIRST** (`add_proxy(path)` with NO `.p3d`); only
> then re-judge the geometry-space convention below. **RESOLVED + VERIFIED in-game 2026-06-24 (MercedesAMGLF AC1.4 PASS): the full confirmed convention is the block below.**
> Meta-lesson: for proxies, the offline frame/render is NOT a sufficient gate — the gate is the in-game render.

The session-1 guidance above ("vanilla doesn't proxy the body → prefer re-fit") is **superseded**: detailed
car mods DO proxy the body and it works. **CONVENTION CONFIRMED in-game 2026-06-24 (MercedesAMGLF AC1.4 PASS).**
A pure-geometry proxy (1 visual LOD, no config class — vanilla `prox_int`/`sedan_engine`, kt_roadkill `_body`,
Star_Audi_R8 `chassis1`/`eng`) needs ALL THREE of:

> 1. **Geometry in MODEL-SPACE** (real car position, NOT re-centered). Verified by debinarizing the vanilla
>    proxy `.p3d`: `prox_int` Y[0.36,1.56] (cabin), `sedan_engine` Z[-2.30,-1.12] (front).
> 2. **Proxy selection path WITHOUT `.p3d`** (`proxy:<path>.<NNN>`). The engine appends `.p3d`; a doubled
>    `.p3d.p3d` → proxy silently absent in-game (offline py3d still "sees" it). Vanilla + kt_roadkill confirm.
> 3. **Proxy-triangle FRAME = `R=((-1,0,0),(0,0,1),(0,1,0))`** — the value `py3d.derive_proxy_frame` returns
>    for vanilla `prox_int`/`sedan_engine` AND kt_roadkill `_body`/`drivewheel`. Author with
>    `add_proxy(path, origin=(0,0,0), rotation=((-1,0,0),(0,0,1),(0,1,0)), scale=0.1)`.
>    **CRITICAL TRAP:** py3d's `canonical_proxy_triangle(rotation=None)` ("identity") is NOT engine-identity —
>    the engine RENDERS IT ROTATED ~90°. That false "identity" passed every offline check yet failed in-game
>    twice (the green-in-false gate). Replicate the MEASURED vanilla/KT frame; never trust py3d's "identity".

Attachment proxies (wheel/crew/door) are NOT a placement reference: they are placed by physics/config (axles,
`proxyPos`) so their non-zero `pos` misleads. Re-fit/decimate is the WRONG default for a high-detail body
(MercedesAMGLF body ~167k resolved → ~60% decimation); proxies are correct and work when authored as above.
The transform-scale reference (`friend_visual_bbox`) must be a STABLE artifact (the donor `.p3d`), never the
deployed shell (pointing at your own output shrinks scale ~3%/rebuild). **Meta-lesson: for proxies the offline
frame/render is NOT a valid gate — the gate is the in-game render.** SUB_BRZ's "crew/wheel not found in
view/fire geometry" spawn blocker is very likely THIS bug (doubled-`.p3d` proxy paths) — apply rules 1-3 there.


## GET-IN RADIAL + LOD LADDER en coches proxy-body (added 2026-06-27, MERCEDES_AMGLF)

### Script binding (precondition, silent failure)
A car `class X: CarScript` whose `CfgMods.<Mod>.defs.worldScriptModule` does not declare `dir = "<Mod>";` or uses
forward-slashes in `files[]` → module does NOT load → script class never binds → get-in trio (and every
override) is DEAD without error (`script.log` 0-byte = false-clean; telemetry reports BASE class `CarScript`).
Fix: `dir = "<Mod>";` + backslashes `files[] = {"<Mod>\scripts\4_World"}` (like SUB_BRZ/LFQuad). Confirm with
telemetry `ClassName()` ≠ base. For telemetry to read the EXACT config-class name, the leaf class
`class <Mod> extends <Mod>_Base {}` is required. See LL-163.

### The "Get in" radial — blocker is GEOMETRIC (collision component + crew proxy), NOT `GetCrewIndex`
> Correction 2026-06-27: an offline audit hypothesized that source-game cars were missing the `GetCrewIndex`
> override. **REFUTED in-game** — MERCEDES s8 resolved DRIVER get-in without touching `GetCrewIndex`
> (telemetry `comp=0 crewIdx=0`, "native mapping works"). Source of truth is **Addendum 2026-06-27
> "Crew get-in" of `references/vehicle-structural-parity.md`** (VERIFIED in-game LFQuad D34 + MercedesAMGLF). Summary:

`CrewPositionIndex(componentIdx)` (native, transport.c:116) resolves the seat by the **collision component
hit by cursor raycast in ViewGeo** (`ObjIntersectView`, actiongetintransport.c:50-51) — NOT by
`GetCrewIndex` nor by memory points. The two real blockers, both geometric:
- an **occluding solid box** in ViewGeo (e.g., a central "spine") → cursor hits it BEFORE the seat
  cube → no get-in. Fix = delete it (MERCEDES driver, in-game).
- each seat = its **own clean, dedicated ComponentNN** (closed cube, dual-tag); painted onto a multi-component
  grid → "always driver", codriver is never hit (MERCEDES codriver = OPEN; LFQuad D34).
- pose comes from **CANONICAL crew-proxy triangle** (edges ~1.0/2.0), not from tiny `add_proxy(scale=0.1)`.

`GetCrewIndex` / `GetDoorConditionPointFromSelection` / door system are NOT the path for basic get-in (both
LFQuad and MERCEDES driver display the radial without them). Status: MERCEDES driver RESOLVED, codriver OPEN
(geometric blocker, see its HANDOFF); **SUB_BRZ get-in = FALSE-GREEN** — its HANDOFF acknowledges it: MCP's
`vehicle_enter` forces the seat bypassing ActionCondition; radial was never observed → SUB_BRZ must apply/verify
this Addendum (occluding spine + clean seat cubes) BEFORE claiming it. See LL-164.

### ★ DECISIVE codriver blocker = INWARD-wound seat ComponentNN + point flags 0x0000003F (SP-130; SUB_BRZ s9 in-game + MERCEDES s12 headless `hit=1 comp=6 crewIdx=1`) — RESOLVED in both
**Supercedes above (2026-06-27) and REFUTES LL-164 (does NOT need door system).** "Clean seat cubes, all outward faces" is NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT: a py3d box with `outward winding + point flags 0` passes every offline gate (shape/winding/dual-tag) but is **NOT raycast-collidable** → `DayZPhysics.RaycastRV(ObjIntersectView)` does not hit it → cursor does not resolve any seat → falls back to component0 (driver "works" ONLY via this fallback; codriver NEVER). Mapping `CrewPositionIndex(comp)` was ALWAYS correct — irrelevant as long as geometry does not collide. **FIX (SP-130; copy sealed vanilla control convention, NOT py3d default): seat ComponentNN = INWARD winding + each point flag = `0x0000003F`.** Sealed control `civiliansedan_mlod.p3d` SHA `823585B6EC9727F70C3ABCAD309ECBF7E87DBA1E66FA14A1ECAB9AB1FCA921DD`, ViewGeometry (res 6e15): 478 points / 422 faces; histogram `0x0000003F` → 478 points (100.0%), `0x02000000` → 0 points. Patch s9 changed winding and flags simultaneously and never isolated the flag as cause; safe rule is vanilla control convention. In-game confirmations (SUB_BRZ s9; MERCEDES s12 headless `hit=1 comp=6 crewIdx=1`) and dual-tag are preserved. Apply MINIMALLY: if seats already enumerate as their ComponentNN with correct mapping (verify with crew-probe/PROBE), flip ONLY seat faces to inward + set their point flags + recompute normal — do NOT rebuild all ViewGeo, do NOT touch body. Closed-car: does NOT need shell or high-index seats in ViewGeo (red herring in MERCEDES s11). Gate = in-game or **headless crew-probe** (`RaycastRV` per seat from door, without aiming; anchors at `pos_driver`/`pos_codriver` if they fall inside cube). Mechanism + tooling + control anchoring caveat: `references/vehicle-structural-parity.md` "CRITICAL EXTENSION 2026-06-28" + "MercedesAMGLF CONFIRMATION 2026-06-28 s12". **Status: codriver RESOLVED — SUB_BRZ (in-game) + MERCEDES (headless).** For any new rip/py3d car: apply this up front (do not discover blocker in-game).

### Inverted wheels: measure axis in .p3d BEFORE setting `angle1` (offline check, predicts bug without in-game)
`model.cfg` wheel `angle1` must match `dir` of each `wheel_X_Y_axis` (2 points in Memory LOD):
- UNIFORM axes (all 4 with same X sign) → UNIFORM `angle1` across all 4 (LFQuad `(1,0,0)`; SUB_BRZ `(1,0,0)`→`-6.283`).
- MIRRORED axes (opposite X sign L/R) → alternating L/R `angle1` (Landrover convention).
Applying Landrover right-flip on uniform axes spins right side backwards.
**Audit 2026-06-27:** MERCEDES has uniform axes `(-1,0,0)` but alternating `angle1` (model.cfg:84,97) → inverted
wheels, OFFLINE-predicted. Fix = uniform `angle1`. Offline check: `py3d` → `dir` of `wheel_X_Y_axis`, compare
X signs between L and R (reusable script: `references/audit_getin_wheels.py` — runs on .p3d of both cars + LFQuad).

### LOD ladder for a shell+proxy car (re-import of decimated model)
The body is split into shell-core (carpaint/glass/lights, direct in LOD) + N `mb_` proxies (<65535 resolved
each). For a ladder of visual LODs from a model decimated by the artist:
- Reuse pipeline `phase2\build_proxies.py`/`build_shell.py` PER LOD with decimated regions and proxies with
  suffix (`mb_chassis_lod1`, etc.). LODs whose body resolves <65535 → DIRECT geometry (no proxies); those
  exceeding (typically LOD0/LOD1/LOD2) → shell+proxies.
- Decimate with **headless Blender** (`--background --python`, modifier Decimate COLLAPSE, `use_collapse_triangulate`),
  per-object to preserve groups; re-split by group to regions. Exclude wheels from body (handled via wheel proxy).
- **Keep support LODs (Geometry/Memory/ViewGeo/FireGeo) from DEPLOYED .p3d**, not friend control —
  ensuring any subsequent edit to those LODs survives (e.g., get-in patch in ViewGeo). Transform (scale)
  IS measured against stable friend control (not against own output: shrinks ~3%/rebuild).
- Verify resolved<65535 PER LOD and PER proxy before writing; `verify_amglf.py` must stay 35/35.
- First gentle step (e.g., −20% LOD0→LOD1) preserves close-up quality; accelerate after. Reference builder:
  `<vehicle-import>\scripts\build_ladder.py` (MERCEDES_AMGLF 2026-06-27; salvaged from %TEMP%
  2026-07-06, SHA256 verified): 5 LODs 182k/145k/73k/23k/7k + shadow.

## Occluder membership beats component granularity (SP-130 correction, added 2026-08-31)

The closed-car rule above still stands: when no body ViewGeometry shell is needed,
omit it and keep only the dedicated seat components. When an open vehicle intentionally
needs a shell occluder, however, small components alone do not prove that the seats are
reachable. A finely split cloud can still block every ray if detachable doors or
interior pieces were assigned to the shell.

Build that occluder from shell-owned surfaces. Exclude detachable panels and interior
chunks that have their own functional owner. Gate two independent defects:

1. Calibrate the largest component's bbox-volume / shell bbox-volume ratio against
   a working control and a monolithic-body red fixture. This detects the single body envelope.
2. Cast bilateral door-side ray fans toward every seat component. The first hit must be
   that seat's exact one-to-one `componentNN`. Include separate red fixtures with door
   surfaces and with interior surfaces left in the shell; both must fail.

The ray fan is an offline geometric discriminator with two-sided triangles. It does not
predict engine backface culling, so a green result still needs the in-game get-in cycle.
This correction narrows the earlier closed-car-specific statement that body occlusion was
a red herring; it does not change that measured root cause or restore a shell where none
is required.


## LOD frame parity uses area moments, not raw vertex PCA (SP-219, added 2026-08-31)

**[HISTORICAL OFFLINE MEASUREMENT; CALIBRATE PER MODEL]** A decimator preserves
surface while changing vertex density. Raw vertex centroid and PCA can therefore
report a frame change on a correct LOD (measured false drift:
about 0.035 m and 18°). Compare `LODn` with `LOD0` using area-weighted centroid and
covariance, orient each principal axis with the area-weighted third moment, and
return `INCONCLUSIVE` when an axis or its sign is degenerate. Calibrate angular and
centroid tolerances on a working pair from the same model family; measured examples
of 2° and 0.02 m are not universal defaults. Enumerate the LOD files from the host's
`proxy:` selections rather than a hand list.

## Modern `Car` ground-contact correction (SP-355, added 2026-08-31)

This supersedes both earlier rows that call `LandContact` optional for a modern
DayZ `Car`. Do not carry or add a `LandContact` LOD: ground contact uses the tyre's
wheel collider plus the small `wheel_*_damper_land` component in Geometry. Treat a
different vehicle archetype as a separate contract and calibrate it against a
working control before introducing any contact LOD.
