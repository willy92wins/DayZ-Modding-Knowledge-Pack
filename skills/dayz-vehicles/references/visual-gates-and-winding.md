# Visual gates and winding — session changelog (imported cars)

> Historical, volatile per-session record of preflight item #10 ("Imported-car offline VISUAL gates that LIE"), sub-entries #10(a)-#10(o), spanning sessions s14->s23 of LFQuad -> SUB_BRZ -> MercedesAMGLF. SUPERSEDED entries are kept here as history under their own headers. The single operative winding rule (#10j THE RULE) lives in the core SKILL.md, not here.

The core SKILL.md keeps item #10 as a stub pointing here plus THE RULE; this file is the full detail. Incoming cites of the form `#10(x)` resolve against the sub-entries below.

10. **Imported-car offline VISUAL gates that LIE — the #7 family (offline geometry heuristic ≠ in-game truth).**
   (a) **Steering axis is NOT a reliable offline plane-fit.** A ripped/regen steering wheel is rim+spokes+hub,
   not a flat disc — PCA / rim-only fit / normal structure-tensor disagree by **12–48°** on the SAME mesh
   (MercedesAMGLF s14, measured 4 ways). The offline disc-normal gives only the CORRECTION DIRECTION (more/less
   reclined vs the current `drivewheel_axis`), never a trustworthy angle. Use the all-points PCA normal through
   the wheel centroid as a first cut, then confirm the flat-in-plane spin IN-GAME / against the user's full-lock
   wheel photos — that is the gate. Refines the QUICK TRIAGE "PCA the disc normal" row, which over-claims offline
   reliability. (s14: applied offline, in-game confirmation pending.)
   (b) **A single-sided imported shell renders SEE-THROUGH from INSIDE the cabin** (roof + floor especially — no
   interior backing). The body is solid from OUTSIDE (winding correct) yet the driver sees sky/ground through
   roof/floor because those skins backface-cull from below/above. Fix = **per-piece double-side**, NOT a global
   winding flip (that inverts the whole car — the s13 disaster in #7): duplicate each roof/floor face with
   reversed winding (`[0,2,1]`) + the normal NEGATED — append the negated vector to `lod.facenormals` (a POOL
   indexed by `vertex.normal_index`, so reusing the index would NOT flip it) and add the twin to the same
   selections. Additive ⇒ it cannot invert the car; identify roof/floor by region + geometric normal, but the
   driver-seat view is the gate. (MercedesAMGLF s14, applied; in-game pending.)
   (c) **Debug-spawn fluid gauges read RED unless you fill ALL four.** `OnDebugSpawn` must also
   `Fill(CarFluid.OIL,…)` + `Fill(CarFluid.BRAKE,…)`, not just FUEL/COOLANT, or the dash oil/brake needles spawn
   red-empty and the car looks broken (enum order FUEL/OIL/BRAKE/COOLANT, `car.c:18-23`; capacities are
   engine-default, no config field needed). Extends the empty-fluids QUICK TRIAGE row.

   (d) **The see-through raycast winding oracle is a useful HEADLESS hint, but its RAW output is ~94% false
   positives — filter by body selection or it lies.** Casting backface-cull rays from many exterior directions
   (Fibonacci sphere) and flagging faces nearest only from the minority side is robust and
   pool-of-normals-independent (unlike the #7 normal-vs-normal tautology), so it catches inverted body faces a
   render might miss — and headlessly. BUT volumetric/concave geometry — `suspension`, `trim`, `interior`,
   undercarriage — is legitimately "seen from inside" and floods the count: on the deployed SUB_BRZ, **9152 of
   9736 single-sided faces (94%) were `suspension`/`trim`; only 584 were body (`color`/`glass`)**. Three rules
   make it actionable: (1) **filter by selection** — keep body selections (`color`/`glass`), exclude
   `suspension`/`trim`/`interior`; map face→selection via `(src,fidx)` over `lods[0]` (the visual LOD — verified
   the same LOD the oracle indexes `fidx` on). (2) **full raycast params** — reducing them LIES (`60/40/48`→3127
   vs `260/80/72`→11262, a 3.6× undercount that hides the real distribution). (3) **twin-test** to drop
   intentional double-siding (exact coincident vertex-triple, or centroid <6 mm + opposite normal). (4) **L-vs-R
   asymmetry is the decisive bug tell**: over symmetric geometry, if one side has single-sided body faces and its
   mirror has ~zero, that side's winding is inverted (a real bug), not intentional 1-sided glass (which is
   symmetric). MercedesAMGLF: left tail-lamp glass **310/922** single-sided vs right **0/922** -> confirmed
   asymmetric winding bug (rest of car ~clean, 2 `color` faces); for an asymmetry the fix is a **FLIP** (match the
   good side), distinct from #10b double-side. Validated gate_car on a 2nd car here (AMGLF = body-in-shell +
   material-less `mb_*` proxies -> just a new profile, no code change). Still a HINT
   (method #2), NOT the final gate — in-game render decides. The pipeline tool that encapsulates this is
   `<vehicle-import>\scripts\gate_car.py` (profile-driven `body_selections`/`exclude_selections`; raycast oracle
   `<vehicle-import>\tools\raycast_winding.py`). Verified by direct measurement on the deployed BRZ (2026-06-30).

   (e) **The source ASSEMBLY emits every body face TWICE -> coincident same-winding DUPLICATES that z-fight into a
   grey/black/blue triangle speckle "all over the body" -- the s7-s15 "winding" RED HERRING.** The faces are
   correctly wound, just DUPLICATED (same 3 verts, same normal, DIFFERENT UV channel: TEXCOORD0 tiling vs TEXCOORD2
   swatch); it PREDATES decimation (proven vs the pre-decimate backup -- identical exact-dup count), so every
   decimation/winding fix MISSES it. On SUB_BRZ chunk_03 was **71% duplicated**, chunk_05 50%. Detector
   (NON-tautological, unlike the #7 winding-vs-normal): count coincident faces per `(frozenset(point_indices),
   winding-parity)` AND per identical rounded vertex POSITIONS -- a clean car ~0 coincident, a duplicated one
   10-70%. Fix = **de-dup keeping ONE face per (position-set, normal-DIRECTION) group**: same-direction copies are
   redundant (drop, prefer the UV-in-[0,1] swatch copy), OPPOSITE-direction pairs are the intentional double-side
   (#10b) -> KEEP both; never drop a `proxy:` face (wheels). Tools `dedup_faces.py` (index+parity) +
   `position_dedup.py` (position-identical; scripts not preserved -- the backup of their output lives in
   `SUB_BRZ_dev\_backups\2026-07-01-posdedup`, re-derive from this entry if needed) -- SUB_BRZ s16 removed
   20320 faces, z-fight gone in-game, body+structure intact. **Add a de-dup pass to the importer so car #2 is born clean.** Detail: rip-import.md SS VISUAL
   CORRECTNESS. (SUB_BRZ s16 2026-07-01, confirmed in-game.)

   (f) **PRIMARY winding gate = per-piece TOPOLOGICAL uniformity — run it BEFORE the see-through raycast
   (#10d).** The raycast finds faces inverted vs the EXTERIOR; it does NOT prioritize faces inverted vs
   their own NEIGHBOURS inside a piece — the more basic defect, and the source of the triangular artifacts
   the user sees in-game. Cheap, deterministic, no raycast: per selection, WELD vertices by rounded
   position, then check every interior edge (shared by 2 faces) is traversed in OPPOSITE directions; two
   faces traversing it the SAME way = a mixed-winding pair. Any visible piece with >0 mixed faces FAILS
   (this is Blender's "Make Normals Consistent" as a gate). Measured on the deployed BRZ: glass 18.2% of
   area mixed (the backlight), color 192 faces (hood + scattered), light 86, trim 12, tail 8;
   interior/suspension uniform. Tool: `<vehicle-import>\scripts\winding_consistency.py --car <profile>`. Full
   winding FIX (amended s20): de-dup first (#10e), then make each piece consistent (MAJORITY flood-fill per
   connected component, excluding >2-face edges); orientation then comes from the raw source winding
   VERBATIM (#10j) — do NOT add an orient-outward pass (raycast/centroid): a correct exterior is only
   ~1.6-14.3% cross-outward (the engine renders the ANTI-cross side) and legitimate cabin-side pieces
   (`glass*int_a` 92-100% outward) face the cabin. This is the FIRST winding
   check on any imported model; #7 / #10d / in-game render come after. (the author feedback, gate_car BRZ
   2026-07-01: shipped gate_car on see-through and skipped this basic per-piece uniformity check.)

   (g) **First-person INTERIOR invisible / "see the world through the car" = single-sided ViewPilot(1100) LOD ->
   DOUBLE-SIDE it, do NOT orient-inward (SUB_BRZ s17, CONFIRMED in-game).** DayZ renders the vehicle's ViewPilot LOD
   at the seated player's HEAD (`dayzplayercameravehicles.c`); a single-sided rip interior + `0x20000` flag renders as
   "few things drawn + world seen through" from the seat (winding-culled; MLOD per-face flags do nothing at
   all — binarize discards the field, round-trip 2026-08-24, rip-import.md invariant #1). Orientation
   is NOT the fix (measured: SUB_BRZ MORE toward-head than vanilla civiliansedan yet invisible -> more-inward != more-
   visible). FIX = per ViewPilot face, add a reversed-winding TWIN with the NEGATED per-vertex smooth normal (dedup the
   pool) + set all ViewPilot flags to 0 (vanilla parity); feasible when resolved-verts <~32k (doubles to <65535).
   Detail + the vanilla-diff that pinned it: rip-import.md SS VISUAL CORRECTNESS #5. (Residual: rip interior reads
   GREY -> material pass, not geometry.)
   SUPERSEDED as primary fix by (i)/(j) (s20): the defect was import ORIENTATION (orient_authored wrong for
   every piece, #10j); the s19 in-game-confirmed fix is single-sided RAW winding as a prox_int-style proxy.
   The s17 "orientation is NOT the fix" inference used the flawed `__N` oracle. Double-siding remains a
   fallback only, at the cost of ~2x resolved verts toward the 65535 cap.

   (h) [FIX SUPERSEDED by (j), s20 2026-07-02: the detector below (welded-position antiparallel stored
   normals) remains valid, but do NOT heal toward the authored/deployed orientation — the deployed exterior
   at 0.5% stored·cross>0 is the anomaly (prime B1 candidate); stored normals = smooth(+cross) of the FINAL
   winding, and source-inconsistent components are repaired by MAJORITY flood-fill per connected component,
   never the area criterion (it inverted the BRZ rear glass).]
   **Bright/reflective TRIANGLES scattered on imported car PAINT (they catch sky/specular, distinct from the body
   colour around them) = shading-normal SEAMS, NOT winding/z-fight/material.** A per-face winding flip that NEGATES the
   per-face normal (the #10d/#10f fix, or an import/decimation step) leaves those faces' stored normals ANTIPARALLEL to
   their un-flipped neighbours -> a shading discontinuity that reads as a bright (or dark) triangle, while winding is
   fine (#10d/#10f pass), z-fight is absent (#10e), and each face's material is correct per-face. Detector
   (non-tautological): weld the piece's paint faces by position; at each shared position count DISTINCT stored-normal
   directions -- a smooth surface has 1, a seam has 2 antiparallel. FIX = HEAL the orientation, do NOT recompute normals
   from geometry: propagate the AUTHORED orientation across the paint surface (flood-fill on adjacent stored-normal
   agreement `dot(smean_a, smean_b)`) and NEGATE only the minority faces (per connected component keep the majority-AREA
   side, so the approved look is preserved EXACTLY on the majority). Flip only CLEAR seams (`dot < -0.5`, >120deg):
   genuine paint creases at 90-120deg are rare (real sharp edges are paint-to-trim/glass = different material =
   excluded) and rounding one is worse than a faint triangle. **NEVER orient "outward-from-car-centre": a car body is
   NON-convex, so centre-outward matches the authored normals only ~70% -> recomputing that way INVERTS ~30% of the
   paint shading = a full-car regression.** Also SCOPE make-consistent to the COMPLAINT region: a `light`/headlight
   selection is a multi-layer lens+reflector where forcing consistency can invert a legitimate inner layer -- do NOT
   flip a whole headlight to zero a metric the user never complained about (SUB_BRZ s18: `light` 86 mixed were ALL front
   = 723-face flip, skipped; the complaint was rear reds -> only `tail`+`trim`). Tools `<vehicle-import>\s18\smooth_normals.py`
   (thresh sweep + heal) + `winding_fix_t4.py` (make-consistent scoped by selection). (SUB_BRZ s18 2026-07-01,
   offline faceted-positions 3347->1613; in-game gate = user's eye.)

   (i) [MECHANISM SUPERSEDED by (j), s20 2026-07-02: authored normals are inverted NOWHERE (the GLB is
   99.99% winding-consistent); the "70.5% authored" oracle was the pipeline's `__N` (smoothed pre-mirror
   winding), and orient_authored is wrong for EVERY piece, not only the interior. The raw-winding interior
   FIX below stands (in-game OK).]
   **The source-game import orients winding to the rip's AUTHORED normals, which are INVERTED for the
   interior -> use the glTF's RAW winding (SUB_BRZ s19, CONFIRMED in-game).** `rip_p2_shellproxy.
   orient_authored()` flips each face's winding to match its authored source normal. For the EXTERIOR this
   works (authored normals point outward); for the INTERIOR the source-game authored normals are INVERTED vs the
   DayZ convention -> winding ends up backwards -> see-through in 1PP (ViewPilot LOD 1100). Cheap offline
   discriminator: the **toward-driver gate** -- fraction of faces whose normal points at the crewdriver
   anchor -- compared to the same gate on the debinarized vanilla `prox_int` (~35%). Measured on the BRZ
   cabin: authored normals 70.5% (inverted) vs geometric RAW winding 30.3% (~=vanilla). FIX (in-game
   confirmed): rebuild from the **RAW winding + smooth geometric normals** (NOT the authored ones),
   single-side, as a dedicated interior proxy in the vanilla `prox_int` pattern (LODs res 0.0+1100, frame
   `((-1,0,0),(0,0,1),(0,1,0))` verified via `derive_proxy_frame`, ambiguous=False; interior geometry is
   model-space, no companion bone). The interior geometry was structurally SANE (boundary edges ~8-10%,
   like vanilla) -- the defect was purely ORIENTATION. Do NOT patch normals piece-by-piece: the cause is
   the import's orientation step, common to every piece; the fix belongs in `rip_p2_*`. Tool:
   `<vehicle-import>\s19\interior_design_gate.py` (toward-driver gate over orientation candidates:
   authored / raw / outward-of-component / inward-of-component). See LL-178. (SUB_BRZ s19 2026-07-01.)

   (j) **CORRECTION to (i)'s mechanism + the SINGLE import orientation rule (SUB_BRZ s20 2026-07-02 —
   MEASURED offline vs vanilla + two in-game-confirmed artifacts; the reimport's in-game gate is PENDING).**
   source-game authored normals are NOT inverted anywhere: the source glb is winding<->normal consistent
   261191/261227 (99.99%), no mesh <99%. The "authored 70.5%" candidate in (i)'s gate was the pipeline's
   `__N` channel, which is NOT authored — `rip_p2_group.py` captures `l.vert.normal` after
   `bm.normal_update()`, and bmesh drops custom split normals -> `__N` == smoothed(+cross) of the
   PRE-mirror winding. That is why "authored" and "raw" were exact complements (70.5+30.3~=100.8): the
   oracle was the mirror-flipped winding itself. Consequences, all measured (evidence + repro script:
   `<vehicle-import>\s20\s20_measure.py` + `s20_measure_output.txt`):
   - `orient_authored` is wrong for EVERY piece, not only the interior (s12's near-global exterior flip
     was undoing it). RAW winding on the exterior: `body_a` 8.8% cross-outward ~= deployed approved shell
     14.3% ~= vanilla band (sedan `dmgzone_roof` **1.6%** cross-outward — the roof pins the engine
     convention: **the rendered/front side is the ANTI-cross side**).
   - THE RULE: keep the raw glTF winding VERBATIM for ALL pieces (net rip→DayZ = `(-Fx, Fy+Y0, -Fz)`,
     det=+1, preserves the authored visible side end-to-end); stored MLOD normals = smooth(+cross) of the
     FINAL winding (vanilla 96.2% stored.cross>0, brz_int 99.5% and in-game OK; the deployed BRZ exterior
     at 0.5% is the outlier -> prime candidate for the (h) bright-triangle class). NEVER orient winding to
     a normal oracle or to outward-of-centre.
   - Repair ONLY source-inconsistent components (~0.33% of BRZ faces: glassr 108, bodyfoglights 443,
     lights 86+84...) by MAJORITY flood-fill per connected component — never minority-area (sign-ambiguous:
     it inverted the BRZ rear glass; deployed glass measured 73.9% cross-outward = renders inside-only).
   - `glass*int_a` panes are the legitimate cabin-side glass layer (measured 92-100% outward = anti-cross
     faces the cabin): do NOT delete them as "z-fight" — with correct orientation there is none.
   Plan + full numbers: `SUB_BRZ_dev\reviews\2026-07-02-s20-plan-reimport-unico.md`. This entry supersedes
   `references/rip-import.md` SS"WINDING — orient to the AUTHORED source normal" pending that in-game gate.

   **s21 STATUS (2026-07-02): the rule is now TOOLING with offline gates GREEN — in-game Gd still pending.**
   **UPDATE 2026-07-06: the in-game Gd gate has since run — s23 cycle-1 deployed 2026-07-03, user-verdicted
   2026-07-05 (GdR7 ledger); remaining GdR7 issues are work-fixed offline awaiting one joint deploy
   (hardening Tasks 1-11). Live status: `SUB_BRZ_dev\HANDOFF.md` LIVE-STATE.**
   Car #N starts from `<vehicle-import>\scripts\rip_p2_build_v2.py` (+ `rip_winding_core.py`,
   `rip_p2_interior.py`) and the `gates_v2.py` step gate — NEVER from rip_p2_shellproxy v1
   (fail-fast-guarded, and it EXECUTES its v1 build at module level, so its "helpers" are NOT
   importable; copy constants instead). Measured on the BRZ (ledger
   `SUB_BRZ_dev\reviews\2026-07-02-s21-p2-builder-v2-CLOSE.md`):
   - The majority repair flips ENTIRE minority subregions, not just the mixed-edge seam faces: a glass
     piece can flip 24-39% of its own faces while the car-wide total stays ~0.5% (BRZ: 2148/440911 =
     0.49%). Per-piece Ga warnings >1% are the EXPECTED census of source-inconsistent pieces, not a
     builder failure — do not panic-revert per piece.
   - Face-level validation pattern: build the full-detail FINAL vs VERBATIM (R2/R3 off) pair from the
     same npz and Gb+ them — coverage ~100%, opposite == the repair count EXACTLY. A doctrine-scale
     regression (any orient_authored-class pass) reads ~90-97% opposite (measured 97.23% vs the v1
     shell); repair-scale reads ~0.5%. Compare at WHOLE-car granularity, not shell-only (repairs
     concentrate in lights/glass: a shell-only diff reads 1-3% and false-fails the band).
   - Stored-normal sign is COUPLED to the shell convention: v2 shells are smooth(+cross), so every
     downstream rebuild (e.g. `decimate_rebuild.py` after decimation) must also write +cross — a
     -cross rebuild against a +cross shell reproduces the s15 two-tone paint with the opposite sign.
   - The import chain is deterministic: re-running Blender import+group reproduced the npz
     BYTE-identical (SHA256). A changed npz hash on an unchanged rip means the toolchain moved —
     investigate before building.

   (k) **Re-typing a face's VIEW ROLE requires an EXPLICIT orientation decision (flip or twin) —
   the inherited winding is NEVER valid for the new role (SUB_BRZ s22 2026-07-02, GdR4-1, measured
   offline; in-game gate pending).** The cycle-4 glass_int_policy re-typed inner-pane GLASS faces
   into a BLACK occluder band meant to be seen from OUTSIDE, but the faces kept the pane's
   cabin-facing winding -> 100% culled from outside (occ02 raycast: 529/4431 rear-slot + 70/4893
   cowl rays reached the ground THROUGH the car; 0 rays lacked geometry = nothing missing, pure
   orientation). Process rule: any policy that changes a face's view role must pair the re-type
   with an orientation decision — DOUBLE-SIDE (anti-parallel twin, same per-vertex UV = reversed
   per-corner UV rows) when both sides are seen (a simple flip covered the outside equally in
   simulation but de-renders the rim from the cabin). Emit twins AFTER the R3 majority repair
   (pre-repair they make every band edge non-manifold and corrupt the flood-fill graph). Gate
   offline BEFORE burning the in-game cycle: orientation census dot(cross, outward) + occlusion
   raycast — `<vehicle-import>\s21\wf2\occ01/occ02` (post-fix use the PAIR-aware census
   `<vehicle-import>\s22\occ01b_band_pairs.py`: a 1-NN match always picks the original of a coincident
   pair and false-negatives the twin).

   (k-CORRECTION, s22 rebuild-2 — BLANKET double-siding is itself a regression class): twinning
   the WHOLE re-typed band blacked out 68-100% of every window view in-game (the inner pane sits
   0-1mm behind the outer glass; a 15cm BLACK band double-sided IS a painted-over window; the
   occlusion gate alone gave a false green because it measures coverage, not appearance). Twin
   ONLY the LOAD-BEARING faces: `<vehicle-import>\scripts\rip_glass_twin_probe.py` (needy-ray probe:
   ring + pane-bbox GRID verticals + oblique 60/30 from the pane's outward azimuth; twin = first
   double-sided hit of a ray that otherwise ends below floor_y). BRZ measured: 129 of 463 band
   faces (windshield 63, rear 66, sides 0). Two gate lessons that cost an offline iteration each:
   (1) the gate's rays must be a SUBSET of the probe's rays (occ02's zone GRID sampled corners
   the ring-only probe never traced -> 8 leak rays); (2) an appearance gate (band faces as first
   rendered hit through each pane, `s22\wf\v2_probe.py` style) must run NEXT TO the occlusion
   gate — coverage and appearance bound each other (rear window floor: ~50% band = the slot
   closure itself; below that needs structural closure, not twins).

   (l) **Authored LODs can carry FOREIGN geometry — NN material transfer needs a GLOBAL cross-part
   fallback + an extent gate (SUB_BRZ s22 2026-07-02, GdR4-3, measured).** The authored LOD2 of
   `bumperfbadge_a` bakes fascia trim into the badge part (extent 8.4x the full part's bbox
   diagonal; 175/183 faces with their intra-part NN donor >25mm) -> a per-part transfer can only
   donate the tiny real part's types (CHROME) and paints the foreign trim grey in the scoops. FIX
   (rip_mat_transfer.py): faces whose intra-part donor sits >25mm re-vote against the GLOBAL
   full-detail pool (the overlapping neighbour part types them correctly); scan EVERY part for
   extent-ratio LOD-vs-full >1.5x = foreign-geometry flag (warn loudly; the fallback fixes the
   typing, the geometry itself may still need a per-part budget exclude). GOTCHA that bit here:
   numpy fixed-width string dtype truncates SILENTLY on assignment ('PLASTIC' -> 'PLASTI' into the
   badge's <U6 `__MAT` array -> unknown type -> class-fallback BLUE); promote to the pool's dtype
   before any cross-part assignment.

   (l-CORRECTION, s22 rebuild-2 — the UNCONDITIONAL global re-vote is itself a regression class):
   on parts WITHOUT the foreign signature, decimation alone displaces LOD centroids >25mm, and the
   global pool votes brighter NEIGHBOUR parts — the BRZ diffuser shipped 8 BLACK faces as
   METAL/CHROME (donors exhaust/undercarriage/suspension at 23-46mm) = grey jagged artifacts.
   Scope the re-vote to parts with extent-ratio > 1.5x ONLY (the badge signature it was built
   for); everywhere else the intra-part vote stays authoritative (reverts 89/89 accidental
   re-types, measured). Report far-donor counts either way.

   (m) **When load-bearing occluder twins bottom out, close the glass↔body gap with AUTHORED opaque
   geometry IN THE GAP, not more twins (SUB_BRZ s23 2026-07-03, GdR6-1, occ02-measured; in-game gate
   pending).** The inner-pane occluder band sits 0-1mm behind the transparent outer glass (measured
   100% overlap on all 6 panes), so ANY outward-visible band face — twin, flip, or blanket — renders
   IN FRONT of the glass = the grey-window regression. The slot the twins were sealing is the
   annular glass↔body gap; close THAT with NEW geometry kept ≥ glass_clear (~8mm) from any
   transparent glass so it can never re-grey: (a) a skirt lofted from the outer pane's boundary ring
   to the nearest opaque body edge (walk the boundary EDGE LOOPS for continuity, not angle-sorted
   points; overshoot the body target ~15%+1cm so the tip tucks INTO the body solid = no crack); plus
   (b) a SUNKEN BAND for the top-down cowl/rear slots (copy the inner-pane frit faces sunk ~10cm in
   −y = the physical plenum / dash-top panel a real car has there). **DOUBLE-SIDE it** (both
   windings): a single-sided strip is culled from one hemisphere — cross-INWARD renders lateral but
   is culled TOP-DOWN because the glasshouse centroid sits ABOVE the rear deck, so occ02 reopens;
   double-siding in the gap is safe (clear of glass) and renders from every exterior angle. This is
   the "structural closure, not twins" that (k-CORRECTION) predicted below ~50% band coverage. Gate:
   occ02 top-down (0 seethru) + a LATERAL first-hit census + a golden-relative diff vs the last
   deployed (absolute lateral counts include harmless preexisting belt-line rim cracks — gate
   RELATIVE). RESIDUAL not closed by the gap skirt: the lateral WEDGE (sail-panel under the mirror =
   a through-glass-EDGE view into a deep cabin cavity) needs a targeted frit-edge twin AT the glass,
   which risks re-greying → eye-gated, ship + confirm in-game.

   (n) **Decouple the wheel HUB level from the body rally LIFT (SUB_BRZ s23 2026-07-03, GdR6-5,
   offline-measured; in-game pending).** A rally/stance lift belongs to the body (Y0), NOT the wheel
   hubs. `rip_p3_structural.py` pinned `W[k] = (x, WHEEL_R + LIFT, z)` → adding LIFT to BOTH buried
   the hub 18cm above the suspension knuckle, cancelled the visible stance, and collapsed the chassis
   clearance to 7.6cm (vanilla 25.8) = a plausible "won't drive off-road". Add a `hub_lift` profile
   param (default 0.0): hubs sit at the rim contact (WHEEL_R), the wheel meets the knuckle end,
   clearance is restored, and the body lift becomes real rally stance (fenders ~18cm above the
   wheels). config.cpp/model.cfg are untouched — they reference names; the *_axis are memory points
   that ride the hub. Gate: the 4 wheel anchors == WHEEL_R in every structural LOD, knuckle-hub gap
   ≤ 2cm, chassis clearance ≥ 0.20m.

   (o) **Before a full structural re-transplant, VERIFY the builder reproduces the DEPLOYED get-in;
   if it doesn't, deploy the fix as a scripted surgical PATCH of the deployed structural, not a regen
   (SUB_BRZ s23 2026-07-03, T3/T5 deploy, measured).** The deployed structural can carry
   post-processed get-in the builder does NOT reproduce: SUB_BRZ's deployed ViewGeo has a
   23-component collision hull + `crewdriver`/`crewcodriver` BONE-NAMED selections (added by
   `fix_crew_binding.py`, required by config.cpp `proxyPos`) + LOCAL wheel proxies, while the current
   `rip_p3_structural.py` emits a 3-component ViewGeo with NO crew-named selections — a full struct
   transplant would REGRESS the get-in that cost dozens of iterations (#10 s6-s9). So: diff the fresh
   struct vs the deployed PER LOD before transplanting; if the get-in selections diverge, apply the
   geometric fix (hub Δy, crew Δxyz, #Mass#) as a deterministic, gated, by-selection-IDENTITY patch
   of the deployed p3d — move ONLY the wheel/crew/mass selections, gate per-point that nothing else
   moved AND crewdriver/crewcodriver survive, backup + read-back (`patch_deployed_struct.py` pattern).
   Test the patch on a COPY first (never the live file for a get-in edit). The pipeline debt (fold
   the hull + crew-binding into the builder so a full transplant becomes viable for car #2) is a
   separate task.


## `validate()` limpio NO prueba que el winding sea correcto (council py3d, 2026-08-12)

Regla dura antes de usar `py3d.validate()` como gate de winding en un vehiculo: **no puede
ponerse en rojo por la causa que te preocupa.**

El unico check de winding es RELATIVO al Visual LOD (`py3d/__init__.py:934` en v1.4.0, unico
call site `:2059-2069`). Si estan invertidos TODOS los LODs -- el caso tipico del import
Blender Z-up -> Y-up -- todo queda coherente entre si y `validate()` devuelve `[]` con exit 0.
Y si el invertido es el Visual, acusa a los LODs de colision SANOS y sugiere "swap
vertices[1] and vertices[2] on every face of this LOD": seguir esa sugerencia lleva el modelo
al estado que ya no se puede detectar. La referencia ademas es el PRIMER visual del fichero,
no el de menor resolucion (`:2498-2503`), asi que el orden de LODs cambia el veredicto.

Los otros dos instrumentos tampoco valen como prueba de geometria: `save(verify=True)`
(`_verify_against`) y `python -m py3d diff` solo comparan conteos, nombres de selection y
suma de masa. Reproducido: dos modelos con un punto en `(0,0,0)` vs `(99,99,99)` -> verify OK
y `diff` responde `total: 0`, exit 0.

Consecuencia para la §3.5 de `rip-import.md` ("validate() findings that are EXPECTED for a
vehicle, don't chase"): esa lista existe porque el check asume geometria CONVEXA y por eso
escupe falsos positivos en cascos huecos y formas en L. Pero la lectura correcta no es solo
"ignora esos findings", sino tambien **"su ausencia no te acredita nada"**.

Verificacion que si discrimina, en orden de coste:
1. Comparar el orden de vertices de una cara contra el vanilla equivalente debinarizado.
2. `cross(e1,e2) . normal_declarada` por cara -- ambos vectores en el MISMO espacio, con lo
   que el lio left-handed (DayZ) vs right-handed (Three.js) desaparece. Medido sobre 15 LODs
   vanilla: 1274/1274 caras = 100.0000%, frente a un `pct_outward` que oscila entre 0% y
   31.8% sin significar nada.
3. Coherencia de aristas: dos caras vecinas recorren la arista compartida en sentidos
   opuestos. Localiza las caras concretas en inversiones parciales.
4. Test in-game (la textura solo se ve desde dentro = winding invertido).

   - **Winding ratios do not predict render (SP-070, LFHeli OH-1 2026-07-19).** Neither the interior edge-pair (`<vehicle-import>\scripts\winding_consistency.py`, `#10(f)`) nor the ODOL dot-neg cross-vs-stored-normals ratio vs vanilla predicts the render. Real case: edge-pair ≤0.0025%, ODOL 98-100% dot-neg ≈ civiliansedan 96% → methodical PASS, and the model rendered INVERTED (stored normals coherent with the winding: both inverted vs the engine — the ratio measures internal coherence, not the absolute sign the engine renders).
   - **Cheap definitive discriminant = all-flipped A/B in-game (SP-070).** Reverse vertex order of ALL visual faces (~1 line in the assembler, or session `LFHeli_dev/model_src/work/helispy2_rffs/flip_variant.py` with py3d), binarize, A/B in-game with the user's eye (~40 min). EXCLUDE proxy triangles from the flip: their winding encodes the proxy frame (P′). Before the A/B, census the ODOL of BOTH variants: if they come out equal, the A/B is null (anti-nullity gate).
   - **Binarize PRESERVES source winding (SP-070).** Same reader, both variants' ODOL dot-neg census: 99.1% → 0.95%. Do not trust "binarize already normalises to the convention": it normalises nothing. Distinct from the ODOL→MLOD converter inversion (`references/vehicle-structural-parity.md`). When pinning the flip in an assembler: recalibrate its winding gates (the expected fraction inverts) and exclude dots ≈0 from the census (merged symmetric normals give a null dot with no information; on OH-1 they were ~17% of the shell and sank the fraction). OH-1 assembler already ships reversed visual winding on purpose (`FLIP_VISUAL_WINDING = True`): `references/rip-geometry-and-winding.md`. Evidence: `30_Sessions/2026-07-19-lfheli-oh1-r2-winding-ab-flip.md`; `LFHeli_dev/model_src/work/helispy2_rffs/odol_census_report.json`.
