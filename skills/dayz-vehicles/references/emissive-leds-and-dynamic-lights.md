# Emissive LEDs, material swaps, and dynamic lights in DayZ

Covers the full pipeline for LEDs that can change color, emit bloom (glow),
and optionally cast real light on the scene. DayZ runs a hybrid of Real
Virtuality (legacy) and Enfusion (new), so this touches three places at
once: the `.p3d` model, the `.rvmat` material + texture, and Enforce Script.

## 1. Prepare the model and config

For the engine to allow material swaps at runtime, the LED mesh must be a
**named Hidden Selection** on its own.

### In Object Builder (Oxygen 2)

Select the LED faces and assign them to a new Selection. Call it something
like `led_panel` (or `led_1`, `led_2`, … if you have multiple independent
LEDs).

### In `config.cpp`

Register that selection as hidden so scripts can target it by index:

```cpp
class TuObjetoCustom : ItemBase
{
    // Index 0 will map to "led_panel" in scripts
    hiddenSelections[] = {"led_panel"};

    // Default state (off)
    hiddenSelectionsTextures[] = {"TuMod\data\led_off_co.paa"};
    hiddenSelectionsMaterials[] = {"TuMod\data\led_off.rvmat"};
};
```

If you have multiple LEDs, add them in the same order to all three arrays
(`hiddenSelections`, `hiddenSelectionsTextures`, `hiddenSelectionsMaterials`).
Index is the array position.

## 2. Create the RVMATs and textures (bloom / glow effect)

To make something *visibly* glow, you need an emissive material. Create one
`.rvmat` per state/color (`led_red_on.rvmat`, `led_blue_on.rvmat`,
`led_off.rvmat`, …).

### Emissive is a MATERIAL property, not a shader feature

Key insight, verified against BI sources: `emmisive[]` is processed by
the standard pixel-lighting pipeline regardless of which shader runs.
There is no "emissive-only" shader. Any shader that runs the lighting
formula (Super, Normal, Multi, Glass, NonTL, SuperExt, NormalMap*, …)
consumes the material's `emmisive[]` array. So the shader choice is
about **what texture stages you want**, not whether emission works.

### Use the BI-canonical DayZ rvmat pattern. Period.

Authoritative finding after auditing **all 263 rvmats in BI's
DayZ-Samples** repo: **every single one** uses `Super`/`Super` + 7 stages
(for props/clothing) or a terrain-family shader (for terrain). **Zero**
BI DayZ rvmats use `Normal`/`Basic`. There is no DayZ-Samples emissive
LED template — BI's template for any prop, including LEDs, is the
Super 7-stage structure.

Therefore for a new rvmat in a DayZ mod:

| Pattern | Shader | Stages | BI-canonical DayZ? | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| **BI-canonical** | `Super` + `Super` | **7 (NOHQ, DT, MC, AS, SMDI, fresnel, env)** | ✅ Yes | **Use this.** Always. Even for a solid-color LED. |
| SuperExt Stage8-emissive | `SuperExt` + `SuperExt` | 8 stages, Stage8 = emissive map | ⚠ In engine shader table, not in DayZ-Samples | Skip unless authoring an emissive .paa mask and you have test coverage. |
| Normal/Basic minimal | `Normal` + `Basic` | 0 | ❌ Not in DayZ-Samples | Functional (engine accepts it) but non-canonical. Don't use. Migrate old files to BI-canonical. |

### BI-canonical LED template — copy this

Based on BI's [`gorka_normal_g.rvmat`](https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/DayZ-Samples/blob/master/Test_ClothingRetexture/data/gorka_normal_g.rvmat)
(fully procedural, no external .paa needed), parameterized for an LED.
Every stage is mandatory — leaving any out means the rvmat is no longer
BI-canonical.

```cpp
ambient[]       = {0.02, 0.15, 0.02, 1};  // subtle ambient tint matching color
diffuse[]       = {0.05, 0.65, 0.05, 1};  // LED color (R,G,B = 0..1)
forcedDiffuse[] = {0.05, 0.65, 0.05, 1};  // usually same as diffuse for LEDs
emmisive[]      = {8, 60, 8, 1};          // GLOW intensity — ≥5 for visible bloom
specular[]      = {0.05, 0.45, 0.05, 1};  // spec tint (matches color)
specularPower   = 20;
PixelShaderID   = "Super";
VertexShaderID  = "Super";
class Stage1   // NOHQ — flat normal
{
    texture = "#(argb,8,8,3)color(0.5,0.5,1,1,NOHQ)";
    uvSource = "tex";
    class uvTransform { aside[]={1,0,0}; up[]={0,1,0}; dir[]={0,0,0}; pos[]={0,0,0}; };
};
class Stage2   // DT — diffuse/detail color (copy of diffuse RGB)
{
    texture = "#(argb,8,8,3)color(0.05,0.65,0.05,1,DT)";
    uvSource = "tex";
    class uvTransform { aside[]={1,0,0}; up[]={0,1,0}; dir[]={0,0,0}; pos[]={0,0,0}; };
};
class Stage3   // MC — no macro
{
    texture = "#(argb,8,8,3)color(0,0,0,0,MC)";
    uvSource = "tex";
    class uvTransform { aside[]={1,0,0}; up[]={0,1,0}; dir[]={0,0,0}; pos[]={0,0,0}; };
};
class Stage4   // AS — ambient shadow, full (no occlusion)
{
    texture = "#(argb,8,8,3)color(1,1,1,1,AS)";
    uvSource = "tex";
    class uvTransform { aside[]={1,0,0}; up[]={0,1,0}; dir[]={0,0,0}; pos[]={0,0,0}; };
};
class Stage5   // SMDI — specular (copy of specular RGB)
{
    texture = "#(argb,8,8,3)color(0.05,0.45,0.05,1,SMDI)";
    uvSource = "tex";
    class uvTransform { aside[]={1,0,0}; up[]={0,1,0}; dir[]={0,0,1}; pos[]={0,0,1}; };
};
class Stage6   // Fresnel — standard glass-like
{
    texture = "#(ai,64,64,1)fresnel(1.53,2.44)";
    uvSource = "none";
};
class Stage7   // Environment reflection — vanilla DayZ path
{
    texture = "dz\data\data\env_land_co.paa";
    uvSource = "none";
};
```

For a red LED swap `diffuse[]` / `forcedDiffuse[]` / `emmisive[]` /
`specular[]` / Stage2 DT / Stage5 SMDI to red channels. For an **off**
state set `emmisive[] = {0,0,0,1}` and dim diffuse; keep all 7 stages.

### DO NOT fabricate claims about shader behavior without verifying against DayZ-Samples

Documented history of this file repeating mistakes (so future Claude
doesn't loop):

1. **2026-04 (first)**: claimed `Super` + procedural stages "silently
   kills emission". **Wrong.** BI's own `gorka_normal.rvmat` uses exactly
   that pattern.
2. **2026-04 (second)**: recommended `Normal`/`Basic` + 0 stages as
   "the reliable default". **Wrong for DayZ.** Zero BI DayZ-Samples
   rvmats use that combo. It works (engine still accepts RV-era shaders)
   but it is not BI-canonical.
3. **Corrective action taken**: LFPG's 58 `Normal`/`Basic` files were
   migrated to the Super 7-stage template via a scripted audit. All 58
   pass structural verification (every stage present, DT/SMDI colors
   match diffuse/specular, spelling correct).

**Lesson: when advising on an Enfusion/DayZ rvmat structure, always
cross-check against an actual BI-authored DayZ-Samples rvmat before
generalizing. Engine-accepted ≠ BI-canonical.**

### If your LED renders black — debug order

1. **`emmisive[]` spelling.** Must be `emmisive` (two m's, no trailing s).
   `emissive[]` is ignored by the binarizer. Confirmed in every BI file
   and [armake issue #81](https://github.com/KoffeinFlummi/armake/issues/81).
2. **`emmisive[]` magnitude.** For visible glow, peak channel ≥ 5. The
   stove burner uses `{0.85, 0.12, 0.02, 1}` (subtle red hot); LEDs
   typically use `{60, 8, 8, 1}` or `{8, 60, 8, 1}` for a pronounced
   glow. Values < 1 look "dark-red/dark-green tinted matte," not lit.
3. **Power / sync state actually reaching the client.** Log the SyncVar
   before blaming rvmat. A material that looks "black" because its
   container entity never received `m_PoweredNet=true` is a networking
   bug, not a material bug.
4. **Selection index matches `hiddenSelections[]` position.** Off-by-one
   applies the rvmat to the wrong selection.
5. **Only then** consider swapping pattern. If B (Super+procedural)
   isn't lighting on a specific model, the issue is likely a
   file-specific defect (malformed Stage, missing map-type hint, UV
   problem on the target face) — not the pattern itself. Switching
   that one file to Pattern A sidesteps the risk surface without
   proving the pattern was at fault.

### Spelling quirk — `emmisive`, not `emissive`

The Bohemia property name is `emmisive[]` (two m's, no trailing s). This
is a legacy typo baked into Real Virtuality since OFP and preserved by
the binarizer for backward compatibility. `emissive[]` compiles but is
silently ignored. Verified in every BI-authored rvmat and the armake
binarizer source.

#### ⚠ Legacy reference only — Pattern A (Normal/Basic + 0 stages)

**Do not use this for new work.** Kept here only to recognize it in
older community mods. It's a valid engine shader combo inherited from
Real Virtuality, but NO BI DayZ-Samples rvmat uses it. When auditing
an older mod and you find this pattern, migrate it to the BI-canonical
Super 7-stage template above.

```cpp
// led_green.rvmat
ambient[]       = {0.02, 0.15, 0.02, 1};
diffuse[]       = {0.05, 0.65, 0.05, 1};
forcedDiffuse[] = {0.05, 0.65, 0.05, 1};
emmisive[]      = {8, 60, 8, 1};      // ← bloom intensity (green channel peaked)
specular[]      = {0.05, 0.45, 0.05, 1};
specularPower   = 20;
PixelShaderID   = "Normal";
VertexShaderID  = "Basic";
// NO class Stage1/Stage2/... — deliberately empty
```

Red variant: swap the RGB channels (`{60, 8, 8, 1}` for emissive, etc.).
Off variant: set `emmisive[] = {0, 0, 0, 1}` and dim diffuse.

#### Pattern B — Textured emissive (when you really have a texture)

`Super` shader with all 7 stages. Each stage must reference a **real** .paa
file, NOT a procedural `#(argb,8,8,3)color(...)` placeholder. Procedural
stages + Super shader is the trap that produces a black LED.

```cpp
emmisive[] = {1, 1, 1, 1};           // modulates texture; real brightness comes from _e.paa
PixelShaderID  = "Super";
VertexShaderID = "Super";
class Stage1 { texture = "MyMod\data\led_nohq.paa"; … };   // normal map
class Stage2 { texture = "MyMod\data\led_co.paa"; … };     // diffuse
class Stage3 { texture = "MyMod\data\led_mc.paa"; … };     // macro
// … stages 4-7 as vanilla
```

If you don't have authored .paa files for all slots, **use Pattern A**.
Don't fake them with `#(argb,8,8,3)color(...)` — the engine treats those
as invalid and silently kills emission on the Super shader path.

At very high `emmisive[]` values (≥50) the LED center goes white
(burnout) surrounded by the base color — classic LED-on look. For subtle
indicators stay in the 5–15 range.

## 3. Swap materials from Enforce Script

Once the mesh has the hidden selection and you have per-state RVMATs, the
in-game change is just `SetObjectTexture` + `SetObjectMaterial`. Call it
wherever your state changes (on var sync, on action, on tick, etc.). These
run both client and server in most code paths; if only the server mutates
state, make sure to sync it so every client re-applies the material in
`OnVariablesSynchronized`.

```c
class TuObjetoCustom extends ItemBase
{
    void SetLEDColor(string colorType)
    {
        // 0 == index of "led_panel" in hiddenSelections
        if (colorType == "RED")
        {
            SetObjectTexture(0, "TuMod/data/led_red_co.paa");
            SetObjectMaterial(0, "TuMod/data/led_red_on.rvmat");
        }
        else if (colorType == "BLUE")
        {
            SetObjectTexture(0, "TuMod/data/led_blue_co.paa");
            SetObjectMaterial(0, "TuMod/data/led_blue_on.rvmat");
        }
        else // off
        {
            SetObjectTexture(0, "TuMod/data/led_off_co.paa");
            SetObjectMaterial(0, "TuMod/data/led_off.rvmat");
        }
    }
}
```

## 4. CRITICAL — bloom ≠ real light

Modders run into this constantly: **RVMATs do not illuminate the environment.**
A high-`emissive[]` material makes the LED glow on screen (bloom), but step
into a dark room and it won't light the walls or the player.

If you want the LED to also cast light:

- Instantiate a dynamic light from script (subclass `ScriptedLightBase` or
  `PointLightBase`).
- Attach it to a named memory point on the model so it stays glued to the LED
  as the object moves.

```c
PointLightBase m_LedLight;

void TurnOnRealLight(vector colorRGB)
{
    if (!m_LedLight)
    {
        m_LedLight = PointLightBase.Cast(
            ScriptedLightBase.CreateLight(PointLightBase, GetPosition())
        );
        // "posicion_memoria_led" = memory point name in your .p3d
        m_LedLight.AttachOnMemoryPoint(this, "posicion_memoria_led");
        m_LedLight.SetDiffuseColor(colorRGB[0], colorRGB[1], colorRGB[2]);
        m_LedLight.SetRadiusTo(2.0);   // metres
    }
}

void TurnOffRealLight()
{
    if (m_LedLight)
    {
        m_LedLight.FadeOut(0.2);
        m_LedLight = null;
    }
}
```

Clean up on `EEDelete` / `OnStoreSave` so you don't leak lights when the
object is removed.

## Action checklist

1. Split the LED faces into their own named selection in Object Builder.
2. Add that selection to `hiddenSelections[]` in config.cpp, with a default
   texture + RVMAT.
3. Author one RVMAT per desired state with `emissive[]` > 1 for the "on"
   variants.
4. `SetObjectTexture` + `SetObjectMaterial` in Enforce Script to swap at
   runtime. Resync on client side after SyncVars.
5. Optional: spawn a `PointLightBase` attached to a memory point when you
   also need the LED to light up the scene.
