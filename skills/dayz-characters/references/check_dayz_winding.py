check_dayz_winding.py - OFFLINE winding and normal gate for the visual LODs of a DayZ source MLOD .p3d.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  A Blender/Three.js preview is double-sided, so it never shows DayZ's single-sided culling: faces wound the
  wrong way only surface in game (inside-out: textures on the interior), and a wrong normal sign only as
  inverted lighting. This reads both offline, before AddonBuilder.

THE CONVENTION IT CHECKS (dayz-model-pipeline Rule 12, measured in game 2026-10-01; dayz-p3d-audit "Absolute
winding check", engine verdict 2026-09-07)
  In a DayZ MLOD the vertex-order cross product cross(v1-v0, v2-v0) and the stored shading normals both point
  away from the side meant to be seen: into the material, inward on a solid. py3d.blender_to_dayz() writes
  that. Per visual LOD:
  (1) WINDING, per closed shell: its signed volume by winding, the sum of dot(v0, cross(v1, v2)) / 6 over the
      fan triangles of its faces, is NEGATIVE, the production sign. Positive: the cross product points out
      of the material, inside-out for a model seen from outside (a room meant to be seen from inside reads
      positive by design; this gate is not for those). A shell is a set of faces linked only through edges
      that exactly two faces use, once points are welded by position; it is closed when each of its edges is
      used by exactly two of its faces, and its volume counts only when it is coherent (the two faces of
      each edge run it in opposite directions). Never the sum over the LOD: it can hide an inverted part
      (dayz-p3d-audit references/winding-diagnostics.md, Check A).
  (2) NORMALS, per shell and corner by corner: the share of a shell's corner normals that point to the side
      of their face's vector area (the sum over its fan triangles, which turns exactly with a reversal, also on
      a non-convex quad whose first three corners point the other way), read as the winding fix leaves it.
      A normal within 5 degrees of its face's plane has no clear sign and is not read. Above 90 % in every
      shell they agree; that is a tolerance, not proof of every corner: smooth-shaded exports carry corners
      against their face (LFInfectedBig's Rule 12 build, lit like vanilla in game, has 219 of 131,478; its
      body shell reads 99.5 %). Below 10 % in every shell they disagree: with the winding right that means
      the normals point out of the material, and the fix is to negate the normal pool, never to reverse the
      faces; the gate says how many corners that agree now the pool fix turns too. Anything else lists the
      shells, to read part by part, never a corner on its own sign: a normal smoothed across a sharp fold can
      point against a face wound right (py3d README, "Winding", step 3). py3d _pct_normal_agreement's count
      (dayz-p3d-audit's absolute check), over every face of the LOD with each face's first corner only, is
      printed alongside.
  The fixes come in the order of the table in winding-diagnostics.md and of the py3d README ("Winding"): the
  winding first, normals untouched; then the normals against the settled winding.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE
  - A mirror. A det=+1 export with its faces reversed and its normals negated passes
    (winding_fixtures/mirror_a.p3d rendered solid and mirrored in game). Check chirality on an asymmetric
    feature (Rule 12).
  - The direction of an open part (a sheet, an open tube) or a flat one (a face welded to its reversed
    twin): no volume sign decides there. Their faces are reported as not scored; dayz-p3d-audit's
    visibility battery covers them. A visual LOD with no closed shell is not measurable (exit 2), unless
    its normals disagree with its winding (exit 1, without saying which of the two is wrong).
  - Collision LODs: dayz-model-pipeline Rule 18's per-component check.
  - A debinarized model: the ODOL->MLOD converter's winding handling inverts the comparison.

HISTORY
  The version of 2026-06-25 (LFInfectedBig S6) encoded that build's det=+1 recipe: stored normals OUTWARD
  and cross . normal < 0. It failed all three MLODs of the Rule 12 in-game test, the correct one included
  (measured 2026-10-01), and passed the outward-normal state (dayz-characters SKILL.md, OFFLINE GATE).
  Until 2026-10-03 its fix for the shells in between read "negate the normal of each corner that points
  against its face and keep those that agree", and the pool fix's note offered that by hand; a normal
  smoothed across a sharp fold can point against a face wound right (py3d README, "Winding", step 3,
  changed the same day).
