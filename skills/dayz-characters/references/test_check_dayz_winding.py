"""check_dayz_winding.py against the MLODs of the Rule 12 in-game test, and variants of them.

Run from the repository root (or from an installed copy of the skill):
    python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider skills/dayz-characters/references/test_check_dayz_winding.py

The fixtures in winding_fixtures/ are the three MLODs of dayz-model-pipeline Rule 12's in-game test,
byte for byte (DayZDiag 1.29.163709, 2026-10-01: b and a solid, c inside-out; a is mirrored), plus b with its
normals negated. make_fixtures.py regenerates them with py3d >= 1.8.0. Each test ties a verdict line to the
measurement it reports - the volume sign and the agreement - so a test cannot pass on a phrase with the
sign turned.
