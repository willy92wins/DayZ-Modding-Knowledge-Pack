# CF ModStorage Contract

## Scope

Use CF ModStorage when a mod stores data on an entity it does not own, or when
that data must survive the mod being removed, the entity being saved again, and
the mod later being reinstalled. This contract assumes Community Framework is a
dependency. It is not a universal replacement for the vanilla entity stream or
for administrator-facing sidecar files.

CF exposes the entity hooks `CF_OnStoreSave` and `CF_OnStoreLoad` at
`CF_ROOT/Entities/ItemBase.c:42-44,84-87`.

## Framing

`CF_ModStorageObject.OnStoreSave` writes this outer frame:

1. `CF_ModStorage.VERSION` for the framework data format.
2. The count of mod streams with data.
3. One framed stream for each mod.

The writer and framing are at
`CF_ROOT/ModStorage/CF_ModStorageObject.c:46,62,64-71`; the current framework
constant is `CF_ModStorage.VERSION = 5` at
`CF_ROOT/ModStorage/CF_ModStorage.c:9`.

The outer framework version is not the payload version of every mod. Each mod
owns its stream contents and compatibility decisions.

## Version unit: the mod

A mod's version chain is:

`CfgMods storageVersion` -> `ModStructure.GetStorageVersion()` ->
`CF_ModStorage.m_Version` -> `CF_ModStorage.GetVersion()`.

The config value is loaded and wired at
`CF_ROOT/Mods/ModStructure.c:61-63,307`; CF assigns it to the storage object at
`CF_ROOT/ModStorage/CF_ModStorage.c:274`; consumers read it through
`GetVersion()` at `CF_ROOT/ModStorage/CF_ModStorage.c:41-44`.

Use that value to branch the mod payload's reader. Do not use the DayZ build as
the only mod-format version: two mod releases can write different payloads on
the same DayZ build.

## The three compatibility cuts

| Cut | Reader behavior |
|---|---|
| DayZ game version `< 116` | Return success without consuming a CF payload. |
| DayZ game version `116..140` | The current framework-header branch is not entered; no current framed mod records are consumed. |
| DayZ game version `>= 141`, then CF data version `< 2` | Read the framework version, return success before the mod count, and expose no mod records. |

The first cut is implemented at
`CF_ROOT/ModStorage/CF_ModStorageObject.c:90-93`. The framework-version cut is at
`CF_ROOT/ModStorage/CF_ModStorageObject.c:121-124`. The threshold constants
`116`, `141`, and `2` are declared at
`CF_ROOT/ModStorage/CF_ModStorage.c:11,12,14`.

Malformed framed reads are not compatibility cuts. A failed framework read emits
`FormatError` and returns `false`
(`CF_ROOT/ModStorage/CF_ModStorageObject.c:109-113,127-131`). If fewer mod streams
are read than the declared count, the load returns `false`
(`CF_ROOT/ModStorage/CF_ModStorageObject.c:149-150`). Do not apply staged mod
state after either failure.

## Uninstall and reinstall guarantee

CF retains each mod's framed bytes independently from whether that mod is
currently loaded. When a known block belongs to an unloaded mod, CF writes the
stored bytes back unchanged
(`CF_ROOT/ModStorage/CF_ModStorageObject.c:73-77`). Therefore this cycle preserves
the block byte for byte:

1. Save with mods A, B, and C loaded.
2. Load without B.
3. Save again while B remains absent.
4. Reinstall B and load the new save.

B cannot consume its payload while absent, but its block remains in the outer
frame and becomes available after reinstall. This byte-preserving re-emission is
CF ModStorage's differential property.

## What CF does not solve

CF provides framing, mod-specific version delivery, and unloaded-block
preservation. The mod still owns all of these obligations:

- Define the payload's field order, types, and independent migrations.
- Classify legacy, known, future, truncated, and rollback inputs.
- Stage payload reads and reject partial state on any failure.
- Back up before automatically rewriting migrated data.
- Rate-limit diagnostics for future or malformed data.
- Provide administrator inspection or repair outside the game when required.
- Provide recoverable sidecar replacement; CF supplies no rename, backup, or
  atomic file transaction.

CF also cannot preserve a vanilla subclass's unframed appended bytes after that
subclass disappears. That guarantee exists only for data written through CF's
own per-mod framing.

## Verification checklist

- The outer framework version, mod count, and every stream are read completely.
- The mod payload branches on its `storageVersion` or its own header, not only on
  the DayZ build.
- Game-build and framework-data compatibility cuts are distinct.
- Failed or partial outer reads return `false` and commit no staged state.
- An unloaded middle mod's raw block is identical after save/load/save.
- Reinstalling the mod exposes the same mod version and payload bytes.
- Payload migration, rollback, and corruption handling are declared separately.
