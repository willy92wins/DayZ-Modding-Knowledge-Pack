# Winding Diagnostics — Deep Methodology

> Extracted from dayz-p3d-audit/SKILL.md 2026-07-07 (F3). The core SKILL.md keeps the index/summary and points here.



Moved from `DayZ Projects/CLAUDE.md` 2026-05-04. It is the winding validation
detail learned in production with Crate_Wooden and WallLamp. Complements
section 1 ("Inverted Face Winding") with validation methodology, gotchas, and
complete import checklist.

#### How NOT to verify — misleading heuristics

⚠️ **Centroid-based check (`cross(e1, e2) · (face_centroid - LOD_centroid) > 0`):**
- It is **right-handed** (Three.js / OpenGL convention). DayZ is **left-handed**. A CORRECT model will appear as "winding inward" in that check, with its declared normals inward too (Rule 12 of `dayz-model-pipeline`) — not incoherence, it is the opposite sign of cross product between systems. *(Corrected 2026-10-02: this line said a correct post-flip model has OUTWARD declared normals, the older convention that Check A below labels UNIFORM_FLIPPED.)*
- Assumes **convex geometry** (compares against LOD centroid). For hollow boxes with thick walls, correct interior faces are marked as "inverted".
- **Conclusion: DOES NOT WORK for validating absolute DayZ winding.** The `dayz-p3d-audit` skill had it for months and produced up to 100% false positives on correct models. Only valid for relative consistency before/after SAME operation, or compared against a reference vanilla.

⚠️ **Comparing `face.vertices[i].normal` with cross product directly does NOT work.** Normals in `lod.facenormals` pool are smoothed per-vertex-corner (smoothing groups): on flat faces they match flat normal; on smoothed faces they do not. To use them as "intent" reference one must **average normals of the 3-4 corners of ONE face** and compare against `cross(e1, e2)`: Check A below. `audit_p3d.py` does not run Check A; its winding findings come from py3d `P3D.validate()`, whose absolute check (`ERR_WINDING_VS_NORMALS`, `SKILL.md` "Absolute winding check") takes the first corner's normal. *(Corrected 2026-10-02: this line pointed at Check A in `audit_p3d.py`.)*

⚠️ **Assuming `lod.facenormals[i]` is normal of `lod.faces[i]`.** False. `lod.facenormals` is a global POOL (size = MLOD header `num_facenormals`, **independent** of `len(lod.faces)`); each Vertex points to it via `normal_index`. Confusing them leads to checks that never run (length mismatch) or checks comparing wrong things.

#### How TO verify

1. **Check A — winding-vs-averaged-normal per face (DIAGNOSTIC).** For each face, calculate `n_winding = normalize(cross(v1-v0, v2-v0))` and compare with normalized average of `face.vertices[i].normal` over corners. On a quad that is not planar and convex, take `n_winding` from the face's vector area instead, the sum of `cross(v[j] − v[0], v[j+1] − v[0])` over its fan (step 3 of "From Check B to fix"): its first three corners can point the other way. On a triangle the two are the same; the SUB_BRZ door and the Rule 12 MLODs measured below are all triangles. % of faces with `dot < -0.5` counts the faces that strongly disagree with their stored normals; it does not say which way either one points (Rule 18 of `dayz-model-pipeline`). Leave `proxy:*` triangles out of this census and out of every fix below: their vertex order encodes the proxy frame (see "Render-sign A/B" below).
   - **~0% UNIFORM_NON_FLIPPED** → no face strongly disagrees. Count agreement as well, on the same averaged normal (`dot > 0`): only ≈ 100 % agreement means winding and normals agree, because normals turned 90-120° away from their faces also read 0 % here. The absolute check in `SKILL.md` counts agreement on the first corner's normal only, so on smoothed normals the two counts can differ; a face whose corner normals point opposite ways is a defect to inspect, not a sign to flip. A correct Rule 12 export reads this with ≈ 100 % agreement (`dayz-model-pipeline`: cross product AND stored normals both INWARD), like the production MLODs in `SKILL.md` "Absolute winding check: what 0 % means". So do a det=+1 mirror with reversed faces and negated normals, and an inside-out model with both OUTWARD. → severity NOTE: consistent with Rule 12, not proof of it.
   - **~100% UNIFORM_FLIPPED** → they disagree. The older outward-normal convention reads this: cross product inward, normals outward, as in the LFInfectedBig det=+1 recipe (`dayz-characters`; `check_dayz_winding.py` passed this state until its 2026-10-02 rewrite for Rule 12, and now fails it on the normals). It renders solid but is not what Rule 12 writes. Crate_Wooden read this state: **Empirically verified with Crate_Wooden 2026-04-25 in-game: render/bullets/cursor/collision all OK.** A correct export whose faces were reversed afterwards also reads it, and is inside-out. → severity WARNING on a new export.
   - **5-95% MIXED** → parts in different states, not a verdict by itself. [OFFLINE MEASURED 2026-10-02] The SUB_BRZ co-driver door MLOD of `SKILL.md` "Absolute winding check" (verified in game; its 26 % agreement reproduced) reads MIXED: 72.67 % of 11,921 faces at `dot < -0.5`, 25.9 % agreeing. Check B finds 1 of its 17,542 two-face edges traversed the same way by both faces (a paint triangle against a black-trim one); with that edge cut, each of its 23 welded components orients as one group with no conflict, so no face group is wound against its neighbours, and that seam is left to inspect. The parts vote apart: the exterior paint, black trim and mirror read 94-100 % of their faces flipped (the paint winds its cross product into the door and stores its normals toward the outside: the older outward-normal convention, which renders solid and, measured on a character, lights inverted — `dayz-characters`, 2026-10-02; not checked on this door), while the cabin plastic, leather and metal and the glass read 97.9-100 % agreeing. Coincident twins (opposite winding, centroids within 2 mm) are 144 faces, and the census without them is unchanged (72.7 % flipped, 25.9 % agreeing). Never reverse the LOD on this reading. Locate any group wound against the rest of its component with Check B ("From Check B to fix", steps 1-2), split the census by part (welded component, then material), and take each part's or group's repair from the table below, each face read as step 3 of "From Check B to fix" reads it (vector area, ±0.5, corner margin): a group whose stored normals disagree with its own winding (still pointing like its neighbours') needs `reverse()` only (fourth row), and the coupled negation of "From Check B to fix" step 3 fits only a group whose normals agree with its inverted winding (second row). → severity WARNING; a visible part that the table reads inside-out is the defect, its urgency set by visibility ("From Check B to fix", item 2). *(Corrected 2026-10-02: this bullet read "real bug, inconsistent render/collision between faces. → severity CRITICAL", which that door, verified in game, contradicts; `SKILL.md` "Absolute winding check", rule 2.)*

   Coordinate-system-agnostic. Neither uniform label is a fix instruction. First decide, part by part, whether the cross product points AWAY from the side meant to be seen (into the material: the MLOD convention of Rule 12, which on a solid seen from outside is inward) or TOWARD it:

   - visual LOD: the signed volume by winding of each closed shell. Weld points by position, then link two faces only through an edge that exactly those two faces share: parts that merely touch (a common vertex, or an edge used by more than two faces) stay separate shells, and a shell with an open edge has no meaningful sign. Negative = away from a viewer outside, the production sign of a solid (`SKILL.md` "Absolute winding check", rule 4); positive = away from a viewer inside, what a room meant to be seen from inside reads. Never decide on the sum over the LOD, nor on a union you cannot split into closed shells: it can hide an inverted part, and reversing it can move the inversion onto a healthy one;
   - collision LODs: Rule 18's per-component outward check; their whole-LOD sign is mixed even on shipped models (rule 7 there);
   - open sheets and double-sided parts: no sign decides; use the visibility battery of "From Check B to fix".

   Then fix the side that is wrong, part by part (a normal shared with a face you leave alone gets a new pool entry: item 3 of "From Check B to fix"):

   | Winding vs stored normals | Cross product | State | To reach Rule 12 |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | agree: UNIFORM_NON_FLIPPED and ≈ 100 % agreement | away from the visible side | Rule 12 | nothing |
   | agree | toward the visible side | inside-out, normals toward the viewer too | `face.vertices.reverse()` on every face of the part AND negate its normals |
   | disagree: UNIFORM_FLIPPED, or ≈ 0 % agreement | away from the visible side | normals toward the viewer: the older outward-normal convention | keep the winding, negate the normals (`SKILL.md` "Absolute winding check", rule 5) |
   | disagree | toward the visible side | a correct export with every face reversed | `face.vertices.reverse()` on every face of the part, keep the normals |

   A det=+1 mirror lands in the same row as its unmirrored twin: whatever the row, check chirality on an asymmetric feature (Rule 12).

   [OFFLINE MEASURED 2026-10-02] On the three MLODs of the Rule 12 in-game test (2026-10-01, DayZDiag 1.29.163709), rebuilt byte for byte by `tools/py3d/tests/test_s7_blender_to_dayz.py`, Check A reads UNIFORM_NON_FLIPPED (0 %; 48 of 48 faces agree) on all three: the correct export, the mirrored one and the inside-out one. Their signed volumes are −0.1086, −0.1086 and +0.1086. The same model built with the LFInfectedBig recipe, and the correct export with every face reversed, read UNIFORM_FLIPPED (0 of 48 agree) at −0.1086 and +0.1086. Two variants of the correct export show what a label or a LOD-wide sum misses: with one of its four boxes reversed and that box's normals negated it still reads UNIFORM_NON_FLIPPED with a negative sum (−0.0822), while that box alone reads +0.0132 (linking faces only through edges two faces share isolates it; joining through every welded edge merges it with a touching box into one shell of +0.0066, and reversing that shell moves the inversion onto the healthy box); with every normal turned to `dot = −0.25` from its face it reads 0 % with 0 of 48 faces agreeing.

   *(Corrected 2026-10-02 against Rule 12, measured in game 2026-10-01. This item called ~100 % UNIFORM_FLIPPED the "EXPECTED state in DayZ (left-handed) after export from Blender (right-handed Z-up)" ("Handedness shift inverts cross product", "No action needed", severity NOTE) and read ~0 % UNIFORM_NON_FLIPPED as "either no handedness transform or normals realigned post-transform". The Crate_Wooden measurement stands; calling its state the expected one does not.)*

2. **Check B — edge-pair topology (MOST RELIABLE).** Two manifold faces sharing an edge must traverse it in opposite directions. If `face1` traverses `(A→B)` and `face2` also traverses `(A→B)` ⇒ one of the two is flipped. Coordinate-system-agnostic. Independent of modeler's intent. **Best tool for detecting mixed winding post-flip.**

3. **Check C — comparison vs vanilla.** Match faces between target and equivalent vanilla (e.g. `DZ/gear/camping/wooden_case.p3d`) by centroid proximity, compare winding-derived normals. Only applicable when there is a close vanilla equivalent in geometry.

4. **Direct in-game test.** Rebuild PBO → test server → inspect visual + collision + actions + ballistic. It is the final filter and the only 100% definitive one. When all previous checks say "OK", test in-game anyway.

5. **In-game spawn is non-negotiable (SP-216).** Offline `.p3d` gates (py3d reload, per-LOD digest, normal budget, resolved vs 65,535, winding parity, indices, degenerate faces, Geometry byte-identical to a p3d that does spawn) **do not authorize spawn**. Never declare a p3d "ready for spawn" by those checks; in-game spawn is mandatory gate. Complements point 4: offline "OK" is not "spawns".
   - **Case (LFHeli HH-60G V8, verified 2026-07-20):** passed those gates — normals 24,404<32,768, resolved 46,905<65,535, winding 100%, Geometry LOD byte-identical to a p3d that DOES spawn — and yet `Won't simulate, it has no geometry`. The "normal budget" theory (root-cause of a previous R21) was REFUTED: with normals reduced to 5,506 it still failed. V8 is a negative capacity control, not a refutation of `binarize`.
   - **Measured cause (SP-122, 2026-07-29, same model):** that message is same defect as `Too many vertices` — engine aborts when loading MLOD, before constructing physics; a valid Geometry LOD does not exonerate. HH-60G cliff: **46,133 resolved triples** (46,133 loads, 46,134 does not; 25 in-game verdicts, zero false ones) in `dayz-vehicles/references/binarize-vertex-budget.md` and invariants #24/#27 of `dayz-vehicles/SKILL.md`. The 46,905 of V8 are above that cliff; `RESOLVED_LIMIT = 65535` is a false friend. **Run `binarize` before touching geometry** (three-state verdict: PASS / CAPACITY_FAIL / OTHER_FAIL). CAPACITY_FAIL → do not go in-game to "fix" Geometry; OTHER_FAIL → do not touch geometry. Visual LOD serialization hypothesis (corner order / TAGG / normal pool, "open RCA" on 2026-07-20) was closed as capacity nine days later; do not reopen as primary suspicion or treat count as irrelevant. If `binarize` yields PASS and game still reports no-geometry, other axes remain and in-game spawn is judge.
   - **Reusable bisection:** N test-classnames in 1 PBO, each with a p3d-variant (LODs swapped via py3d). filePatching does NOT reload `.p3d` binaries; one restart tests N variants. Each classname needs its CfgModels entry inheriting skeleton+crew-bones from actual model. 2026-07-20 origin: without that entry, a config with Crew `proxyPos` bones caused `CreateObjectEx` to crash server (minidump in MCPBridge DispatchWorldSpawn) instead of returning spawn_failed. Orthogonal to SP-070/SP-071 (winding/render). Cross-ref: `dayz-vehicles` (get-in/spawn), `dayz-model-pipeline` (`.p3d` export).

#### Trampas conocidas (lessons learned)
- **`flip_winding.py` applied twice** returns to original state (idempotent modulo 2). If you do not remember if applied, check if backup `.p3d.bak_v4_pre_winding_flip` exists — if present, it was applied at least once.
- **`renegate_normals.py` is DEPRECATED** and based on a misunderstanding. If applied, pool normals are erroneously negated; revert by negating again. See "Reusable scripts".
- **Crate_Wooden has mixed winding in Visual LOD** (38.6% bad edges in Check B, 2026-04-25) but **DayZ tolerates it in render** (verified in-game: visual / bullets / cursor / collision OK). Collision LODs (Geometry/LandContact/ViewGeo/FireGeo) are internally consistent. **The skill marks this as CRITICAL in Check B**, which is good as a preventive signal, even if the engine tolerates it in this particular case. Do not re-flip this model unless a concrete in-game symptom appears.
- **Measured:** setting `face.flags |= 0x20000` did not produce two-sided rendering; the faces
  remained see-through in-game. The route confirmed to work is double-sided geometry. The reason is
  now pinned: `binarize.exe` discards the MLOD per-face `flags` field entirely. Three MLODs differing
  ONLY in `face.flags` (`0`, `0x00000020`, `0x00020000`) binarize to a byte-identical model, while a
  moved point and a cleared texture on the same faces each change it (round-trip 2026-08-24). The
  `0x20000` vs `0x00000020` dispute is moot: no face-flag value reaches the game.

#### From Check B to fix: isolate minority group and flip it ENTIRELY (winding; stored normals as Check A reads them)

Verified method (GunRacks T1/T2/T3 2026-08-28: 156 inverted faces across 11 parts of three
external artist models, player report "plank normals are inverted"):

1. **Isolate**: weld points by position (5 decimals), split visual LOD into connected
   components (excluding faces from `proxy:*` selections), and within each component run
   orientation flood-fill with Check B rule (two manifold faces traversing
   shared edge in SAME direction are opposite). A healthy component yields ONE group;
   a broken one yields two, and **the minority one is the inverted one** — reference is part's
   own majority, never an absolute sign convention.
2. **Severity by visibility, not by count**: render with id-buffer and screen culling,
   with sign CALIBRATED against population (majority of a model looking good in-game
   must come out front-facing; same lesson as centroid-check above). Minority group
   visible from outside = defect reported by players; interior groups (shelf
   edges) = same fix, lower urgency. Signed volume does NOT decide orientation on open
   sheets. **When discarding "residual", measure in PIXELS of visible backface, not in faces** —
   "few faces" can be a strip of hundreds of pixels (measured: 1 face, 636 px); and
   "identical to shipped" does NOT exonerate: shipped asset can carry defect from origin.
   Real legitimate residual: front-dominant faces with minor slit backfaces
   (healthy pattern measured: 4335 px front / 59 back).
3. **Read the group's stored normals, then fix it**: before touching the group, read each of
   its faces with Check A, `dot(n_face, average of its corner normals)` with both vectors
   normalized, where `n_face` is the face's vector area: the sum of
   `cross(v[j] − v[0], v[j+1] − v[0])` over its fan triangles. On a triangle or a planar
   convex quad it points like Check A's `n_winding`; on a non-planar or non-convex quad the
   first three corners can point the other way, and which three they are changes with the
   reversal, while the vector area turns exactly. [OFFLINE MEASURED 2026-10-02] A planar dart
   quad whose reflex corner sat at index 1 after `reverse()`, and a twisted quad reversed by
   `v[:1] + reversed(v[1:])`, sent the first-three reading to the wrong branch in both states
   below; the vector area sent all four right. Then invert the vertex order of every face of
   the group (`v[:1] + reversed(v[1:])`), and per face:
   - **Normals agree with the inverted winding** (reading ≥ +0.5: they turned along with it;
     second row of the Check A table): **negate stored normals of those corners in the same
     pass** — UNLESS pipeline recalculates normals in a subsequent step. This is the GunRacks
     case: there each minority group had its winding AND its stored normals reversed against
     its neighbours', and the fixers of T1/T2 and of the second pass refused to save unless 0
     flipped faces had summed stored normals against the new winding (2026-08-28).
     A fixer that only inverts vertices (e.g. GunRacks `fix_winding.py`) is correct ONLY
     because its pipeline recalculated normals afterwards; copying that mechanic to a pipeline
     without recalculation leaves face visible but shaded inside out (second lost cycle).
   - **Normals disagree with the inverted winding** (reading ≤ −0.5: only the winding was
     reversed, and the normals still point like the neighbours'; fourth row): **keep them**;
     the new vertex order alone makes them agree. [OFFLINE MEASURED 2026-10-02] On a Visual
     LOD made of one Rule 12 unit box, with one face reversed and its normals untouched,
     negating them as well left 5 of 6 faces agreeing (83.3 %, in py3d's absolute check and in
     Check A), while keeping them restored 6 of 6, corner for corner the undamaged model; both
     left 0 edges traversed the same way by both faces. The same held with smoothed normals
     (one pool entry per point, shared by three faces) and for a two-face group with one face
     in each state: 83.3 % after negating both, 100 % after deciding face by face.
   - A face that reads between −0.5 and +0.5 (normals near its plane, where the sign is noise
     and a change of 1e-15 picks the other branch), or that has a corner on the other side of
     it or within 0.1 of its plane (`|dot| < 0.1` against `n_face`: an average can hide one
     such corner, as three agreeing corners and one at 1e-15 average to 0.9487), has no
     reading: inspect it, never infer its normals from the rest of the group.

   Safe mechanics with global POOL: if `normal_index` of the corners to negate are exclusive
   to them, negate in place; if any is shared with a corner whose normal you keep (a face
   outside the group, or a face of the group that keeps its normals), add negated normal as
   new pool entry (32768 budget) and reindex only those corners.

   Close on the whole LOD, not on the group: Check B finds no edge traversed the same way by
   both faces, and every corner normal points along its face's vector area by the same corner
   margin (`dot ≥ 0.1`). A corner that fails is inspected, never negated on this reading
   alone: a corner normal smoothed across a sharp fold can point against one of its faces
   with every face wound right. py3d's absolute check reads one corner per face and the
   group's reading sees only the group, so neither sees corners spoiled outside it.
   [OFFLINE MEASURED 2026-10-02] On the smoothed box, with the reversed face's normals negated
   in place on entries its four neighbours share, this step repaired that face with four pool
   copies and left 8 corners of the neighbours pointing outward; py3d read 100 % with no
   winding finding (each neighbour's first corner was intact), while the corner check found
   the 8 and Check A read 33.3 %. A flat tetrahedron wound coherently inward, with
   area-weighted corner normals, fails the corner check at 6 of its 12 corners.

   *(Corrected 2026-10-02: this item read "**Coupled fix**: invert vertex order
   (`v[:1] + reversed(v[1:])`) **and negate stored normals of those corners in the same
   pass** — UNLESS pipeline recalculates normals in a subsequent step." for every minority
   group, and its pool rule read "if `normal_index` of faces to flip are exclusive to them,
   negate in place; if any is shared with a face not touched, add negated normal as new pool
   entry". That fits a group whose normals turned with its winding, as in GunRacks; on a
   group whose winding alone was reversed it turns right normals wrong (the 83.3 % above).
   The section title read "isolate minority group and flip it ENTIRELY (winding + stored
   normals)".)*
4. **Artist defect RECURS**: measured identical across three consecutive deliveries of
   same model (16/08, 18/08, 19/08) — lives in working file, re-exporting does not cure it.
   Check is run on EVERY delivery reintegration, not only initial import; and
   fixer is anchored fail-closed (expected component centers + exact face count)
   so a differently re-exported breakdown aborts rather than flipping wrong things.
5. **Inverted faces WITHOUT topological minority** (edges/chamfers not sharing manifold
   edges with their part — point 1 flood-fill cannot see them): operational criterion is
   **back-dominance across a battery of views covering entire sphere** — per face, pixels
   won in z-buffer as backface ≥8 and ≥4× those won as front. Second GunRacks round
   (same day): 17 more faces like this, with strips up to 636 px, which first pass discarded
   as residual. Two measured pitfalls when trying to arbitrate by geometry instead of
   visibility: positional gate ("near ymax ⇒ exterior is +Y") errs on hanging
   faces (soffits, shelf bottoms), and bidirectional raycast cannot resolve ~1 mm sheet
   sandwiches (epsilon hit against twin skin in both directions). And verify the
   battery itself: in typical yaw/pitch projection of these rasterizers positive pitch
   LOWERS camera — a "top view" looking from below leaves roof un-audited
   (measured: sought roof defect did not exist, but original battery could not
   know). Closing loop: complete post-fix re-render with 0 back-dominant faces and
   none new.


#### Render-sign A/B and source-profile limits (SP-070/SP-071, added 2026-08-31)

Edge-pair coherence and cross-product-versus-stored-normal ratios test internal consistency;
they do not by themselves predict which side the engine will render. Normals and winding can
be mutually coherent while both use the wrong sign for the target pipeline.

When the absolute sign remains uncertain, generate an all-flipped variant by reversing every
**visual** face, excluding proxy triangles because their winding encodes the proxy frame.
Binarize the candidate and variant, then run an in-game A/B. Before spending that cycle,
measure both derived outputs with the same census and require the results to differ; equal
results make the A/B a null experiment. Binarization was measured preserving source winding,
not normalizing it.

A pre-binarize dot census can be a cheap predictor only inside a calibrated source profile.
Exclude near-zero dots, do not compare ratios across vanilla ODOL, converted MLOD, and raw
DCC MLOD, and do not generalize a generic-DCC flip rule to a vehicle profile with a different
measured source transform. After adopting a flip, recalibrate every expected fraction in the
assembler's gates. The in-game A/B remains the absolute render verdict.
