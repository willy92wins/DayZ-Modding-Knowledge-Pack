# dayz-navmesh-compare

Compare two DayZ navmesh (`.nm`) files tile by tile, by structure rather than
bytes, and say whether the structural changes stay near a terrain edit and
away from the routes you care about. Read-only: the one file written is the
new `--out` report.

## Why not a hash

(claim: CLAIM-NAVMESH-GENERATOR-NOT-BYTE-DETERMINISTIC) NavMeshGenerator does
not write the same bytes twice. In the Baltic 12 km terrain project, two meshes
generated over terrains that differ in 126 height vertices hold 966 289 tiles
each (983 x 983, the 12.5 m layout below). 966 286 of those tiles changed bytes;
138 changed structure (polygon count, vertex count or vertical bounds), all of
them within 14.1 m of a changed vertex. Hashing the two files, or their tiles,
says that everything changed. Source: pipeline inbox fb-20261003-203108-9821,
measured on 2026-10-03 with that project's comparator on its own files (its
`evidence/v30-shore-wave-2026-10-03`, not published). Level `offline_tested`:
measured on files, not in game, and not re-measured for this Pack; the numbers
are the ticket's.

## Verified envelope

(claim: CLAIM-NAVMESH-TESM6-DNAV11-ENVELOPE) Files written by DayZ Tools'
NavMeshGenerator for one 12 km world, 12 288 m on a side, with a TESM version 6
file header and DNAV version 11 tiles, in three layouts: 12.5, 25 or 50 m
tiles, 983, 491 or 245 tiles on a side. The source project's reader accepted
these three layouts and no other; the measurement above is on the 12.5 m one.
Any other layout is read with the same checks and is unverified: the report says
which (`layout.inside_verified_envelope`, and a line in `limits`).

## Run

Python 3.10 or newer, no install. Without terrain inputs it is stdlib only;
`--old-terrain` and `--new-terrain` need numpy.

```powershell
python tools/dayz-navmesh-compare/compare_navmesh.py --old-nm <accepted.nm> --new-nm <new.nm> --out <report.json>
python tools/dayz-navmesh-compare/compare_navmesh.py --old-nm <accepted.nm> --new-nm <new.nm> --out <report.json> --old-terrain <old.npz> --new-terrain <new.npz> --cell-m 6 --local-m 100 --routes <routes.txt>
```

| Status | Exit | When |
|---|---:|---|
| `PASS_NO_STRUCTURE_DELTA` | `0` | No tile changed structure, and the terrain inputs, if given, did not change |
| `PASS_LOCAL_STRUCTURE_DELTA` | `0` | Tiles changed structure, every one within `--local-m` of a changed terrain vertex, none under a route |
| `REVIEW` | `1` | Anything else; `review_reasons` says why |
| usage error | `2` | A flag missing, out of range or without the flags it needs |
| refused | `3` | An input refused or unreadable, the two mesh layouts or terrain shapes differ, numpy missing for terrain inputs, or `--out` already exists; nothing written, `error: <reason>` on stderr |

`review_reasons`, in this order:

| Reason | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `structure_changed_without_terrain_inputs` | Tiles changed structure and no terrain inputs locate them |
| `structure_farther_than_local_m` | A structural change lies farther than `--local-m` from every changed vertex, or no vertex changed at all |
| `terrain_changed_without_structure_change` | The terrain changed and no tile did: a stale mesh looks like this, and so does an edit too small to matter |
| `route_tile_changed` | A structural change lies under a route |

## Inputs

- **Meshes.** Both must have the same layout (tiles along x and z, tile width).
- **Routes**, one per line: `id;x y z;x y z`, the start and end points in
  metres (`y` is read and not used). Blank lines are skipped; UTF-8 with or
  without a byte order mark. Ids are unique. A malformed line is refused with
  its line number, and so is a file with no route. A route covers the rectangle
  between its two points widened by 25 m on every side, and every tile that
  rectangle meets, a tile touching its border included.
- **Terrain**: two NPZ files (`numpy.savez`), each holding a 2-D, finite,
  numeric array named `heights`, of one shape. The vertex at row `r`, column `c`
  stands at x = `c * cell_m`, z = `(rows - 1 - r) * cell_m`: row 0 is the
  largest z. That is the source project's convention; check that your export
  writes rows that way. `--cell-m` is required with them; `--local-m` defaults
  to 100.

## Report

`status`, `review_reasons`; `old_nm`, `new_nm`, `old_terrain`, `new_terrain`
and the SHA-256 of each file read; `layout` (tiles along x and z, `tile_m`,
`tiles`, `covered_x_m`, `covered_z_m`, the format versions and
`inside_verified_envelope`); `tile_m`, `tiles`; `serialized_changed_tiles`
(tiles whose bytes differ), `structural_changes` (tiles whose structure
differs); `changed_terrain_vertices`, `cell_m`, `terrain_extent_m`
(`[columns * cell_m, rows * cell_m]`), `max_structural_tile_distance_m`,
`local_threshold_m`; `route_margin_m` (25); `structural`, one item per structural
tile in `(x, z)` order with its `distance_m` to the nearest changed vertex
(0.1 m, `null` without one) and both tiles' `bytes`, `sha256`, `polygons`,
`vertices` and `y_bounds`; `route_tiles_changed`, route id to the structural
tiles under it; `limits`. Without terrain inputs their keys are `null`, and
without `--routes` the route keys. stdout carries the same report without
`structural`.

## What the reader checks

`navmesh_tiles.py` reads the 48-byte file header (magic `TESM`, version, tile
count, tiles along x and z; origin, tile width and depth), the offset table and
the 100-byte header that follows a 16-byte prefix in every tile, laid out as
Detour's `dtMeshHeader` (magic `VAND` on disk, version, tile x and z, polygon
and vertex counts, bounds). The uint32 at byte 8 of that prefix is the size of
the tile after the prefix and is checked against the bytes to the next tile or
the end of the file; the uint64 at byte 0 and the uint32 at byte 12 are not
interpreted. That size field matched on two Baltic 12.5 m `.nm` files of
966 289 tiles each, two Baltic 50 m `.nm` files of 60 025 tiles each, and the
three vanilla `navmesh.nm` files of Chernarus+, Livonia and Sakhal (94 249,
65 536 and 94 249 tiles): 2 306 662 tiles. It
refuses, naming the file and the check: a wrong magic or version in the file or
in any tile; a tile count other than tiles x times tiles z; an origin other than
(0, 0, 0); tiles that are not one finite, positive square; an offset table that
does not start at 0, is not strictly increasing or runs past the end of the
file; a tile past the end of the file or with no data after its header; a prefix
size that does not match the bytes to the next tile; a tile
outside the grid or present twice; non-finite bounds; horizontal bounds more
than 1 mm off the tile's cell. A tile's hash covers its header and data, not
the 16 bytes before the header.

## Limits

- No polygon topology, links or AI paths are read, and unchanged structure
  along a route is not a locomotion result.
- Both files are read whole into memory, with one small record per tile. A
  synthetic pair of 983 x 983 meshes of 120 MB each compared in 15 s with under
  0.8 GB of memory on the machine that wrote this.
- Locating costs structural tiles times changed vertices. It is meant for local
  edits; meshes over unrelated terrains can take very long.

## Origin

Adapted from `tools/navigation/inspect_navmesh_tiles.py` and
`tools/navigation/compare_navmesh_tiles_v30.py` of the Baltic 12 km terrain
project (commit 84e2bb8, pipeline inbox fb-20261003-203108-9821). Changes:

- The tile width and the grid come from the file header. The source took the
  width on the command line and accepted only the three layouts above; every
  check it made is kept. Added: an offset table or tile past the end of the
  file is refused with a message rather than an exception, and non-finite
  bounds are refused (a NaN passed the source's bounds check).
- Terrain inputs are optional, and numpy is imported only for them. The
  source's terrain grid was fixed (6 m cells, 2048 rows); here it is
  `--cell-m` and the array's shape. `--routes` has no default (the source
  defaulted to a project file).
- **Status when no tile changed structure.** The source returned its review
  status then, whatever the terrain. Here it passes, unless the terrain inputs
  show changed vertices, which is reviewed
  (`terrain_changed_without_structure_change`). Without terrain inputs, any
  structural change is reviewed.
- A structural tile with no changed vertex has no distance (`null`); the source
  wrote `Infinity`, which is not JSON.
- A route covers the exact widened rectangle. The source sampled points one
  tile apart, which could add a row or column past it and leave out a tile that
  only touches it.
- File hashes come from the bytes read: no `hashlib.file_digest`, which needs
  Python 3.11. Refusals exit `3` and write nothing; an existing `--out` is
  refused rather than asserted.

## Tests

```powershell
python -m pytest tools/dayz-navmesh-compare/tests -q
```

Meshes, route files and terrain NPZ files are synthetic, written by the tests.
The terrain cases need numpy and skip without it; the rest is stdlib only.
