# skill-runtime-pin

Stdlib pin of a **complete Pack commit** into a new task-local root, plus one
derived discovery adapter. It is not a universal launcher, not a catalog
quarantine, and it does not run Cursor or Codex.

The capture is every git blob of the named commit, byte-identical, with path /
blob / SHA-256 / size in a manifest. The only extra skill file is:

`<probe-root>/.agents/skills/<skill>-<short-commit>/SKILL.md`

That adapter is **DERIVED**: `name` matches its folder, it points at the
captured `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`, and it holds a task-local canary. The
captured original is never rewritten. The nonce lives in that adapter and in a
receipt **outside** `<probe-root>`. Assembled consumer prompts do not include it.

## Contract

- Default skill: `dayz-mod-workflow`. `--skill` must be a single hyphenated
  name that exists as `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` in the commit.
- Source worktree must be clean. The commit is read through `git ls-tree` /
  `git cat-file`, not the working tree.
- Rejected: dirty source, symlink (`120000`), gitlink/submodule (`160000`),
  path traversal, blob/size/hash mismatch, existing task-root, overlap with
  the source tree.
- Runtime inputs and outputs stay under the new task-local root. The source
  tree is not overwritten.
- `verify` enumerates `<probe-root>` without following links, ignores only
  `.git/**`, and requires the physical file set to be exactly capture blobs +
  the derived adapter. Extra files, symlinks and reparse points fail
  `verify` and therefore `assemble` / `inspect-prompt` / `grade`.
- Catalog identity is an exact canonical path. `inspect-prompt` resolves
  Codex `Skill roots` aliases (`rN/...`) and does not accept another root
  that merely shares a suffix or a copied SHA-256.
- Cursor has no exclusive-catalog flag. Codex `--ignore-user-config` does not
  isolate `$HOME/.agents`. Homogeneous global copies are not disabled. The pin
  is the versioned alias plus a later probe that must show the nonce **and**
  consumption of the original captured `SKILL.md`.
- Lazy reads are accepted only for that original and its `references/` in the
  capture. Zero tool calls are valid only when the host injected that original
  body (exact probe path + hash match). A nonce with neither is a false pass.

## Commands

Run from the Pack root, without installing a package:

```powershell
python tools/skill-runtime-pin/runtime_pin.py materialize --source <pack-repo> --commit <sha> --task-root <new-task-root>
python tools/skill-runtime-pin/runtime_pin.py verify --task-root <task-root>
python tools/skill-runtime-pin/runtime_pin.py assemble --task-root <task-root> --consumer all
python tools/skill-runtime-pin/runtime_pin.py inspect-prompt --task-root <task-root> --prompt-input <prompt-input.txt>
python tools/skill-runtime-pin/runtime_pin.py grade --task-root <task-root> --transcript <transcript.json>
```

`--task-root` must not exist. It is created as:

```
<task-root>/probe/          # capture + derived adapter (consumer cwd)
<task-root>/manifest.json  # commit, tree, per-file blob/SHA-256/bytes, before/after
<task-root>/receipt.json    # oracle: nonce, original hash/path (never inside probe/)
```

Exit `0` is `PASS`, `1` is `FAIL` or a refused pin, `2` is usage. Reports are
JSON on stdout.

## Operator sequence

`assemble` emits `program` and `argv` arrays. It does not launch Cursor or
Codex. A live probe is a **new** process: exec that program with that argv list,
cwd the probe root from `assemble`. Do not attach to a session that is already
running.

1. `materialize` the named `--commit` into a new `--task-root`.
2. `verify` that capture.
3. `assemble --consumer all` (or `codex` / `cursor`) and keep the arrays.
4. `inspect-prompt` against the **raw** Codex `codex debug prompt-input`
   dump (`assemble` records that inspect argv). Walk decoded JSON strings;
   do not regex only the escaped file text.
5. Launch the new consumer process. Keep the **complete** stdout JSONL.
   Do not truncate it to the last line.
6. Normalize a grade transcript from those raw streams: `stdout` is the
   final assistant text only; `tool_reads` are successful tool reads actually
   present in the stream. Cursor `result.result` aggregates commentary;
   the final assistant goes to that normalized `stdout`. Do not invent an
   `injected_bodies` entry that was not observed.
7. `grade` that transcript.

A real run that returns the canary without an original `SKILL.md` read (or
an observed injection of that captured file hash) **fails**
`NONCE-WITHOUT-ORIGINAL`. Do not retry until green, and do not treat one
canary as proof the pin is universally reliable. This document does not
claim the owner's isolated consumer matrix is done.

## Assembled consumers — `[DESIGN]` until the owner runs them

`assemble` writes structured `program` and `argv` arrays. It does not
build a PowerShell `-Command`, does not JSON-escape into a shell string, and
does not launch a model, touch auth, or read a global config. A caller execs
the program with that argv list.

Codex (`program` is `codex`; `argv` includes `codex` as argv[0]):

```
codex debug prompt-input runtime-catalog-probe
codex exec --json --ephemeral -s read-only -C <probe-root> -m gpt-5.6-sol $<alias> <prompt>
```

The Codex CLI does not emit `system/init` or a served-model event in this
pin. `assemble` records `requested_model` via `-m` / argv and sets
`limits.codex_emits_system_init` and `limits.served_model_observed` to
false. Do not invent those events.

`inspect-prompt` must see exactly one catalog entry for the alias, at the
derived adapter path. A `codex debug prompt-input` dump is a JSON array of
messages: walk every JSON string, then parse `Skill roots` and skill
`(file: rN/...)` lines **inside that decoded string**. Roots apply only to
entries from the same string. Regexes must not run only on the raw file
with escaped `\n`. A dump that names `r10/<alias>/SKILL.md` after a
`Skill roots` map is resolved against that root. A different absolute root
with the same suffix is not the adapter. Global `dayz-mod-workflow` hits
may remain; they are a different name.

Cursor (`program` is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\cursor-agent\cursor-agent.cmd`; `argv`
is flags then `-p` and the short prompt last):

```
cursor-agent.cmd --mode ask --trust --workspace <probe-root> --output-format stream-json --model cursor-grok-4.6-xhigh -p /<alias> <prompt>
```

The `flags` object repeats those fields for the caller. No exclusive-root
flag is claimed. The adapter is not a byte-identical pin of the original
`SKILL.md`. Identity of the consumed version is nonce + observed read (or
injection) of the captured original.

## Probe transcript

`grade` grades a **normalized reception** of a real log. It is not an
attestation and not a universal launcher. Keep the raw JSONL; the
transcript is a derived object. `stdout.strip()` must equal the
receipt canary and nothing else.

Cursor:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "consumer": "cursor",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "stdout": "CANARY:<nonce>",
  "argv": ["--mode", "ask", "--trust", "--workspace", "<probe-root>", "--output-format", "stream-json", "--model", "cursor-grok-4.6-xhigh", "-p", "/<alias> <prompt>"],
  "tool_reads": ["skills/dayz-mod-workflow/SKILL.md"],
  "injected_bodies": [],
  "system_init": {
    "type": "system",
    "subtype": "init",
    "model": "Cursor Grok 4.6 Extra High"
  }
}
```

Codex uses `consumer: "codex"`, the assembled Codex argv (including `-m
gpt-5.6-sol`), and must omit `system_init` / `served_model`. Requested model
is the argv value; served-model is recorded as not observed.

Cursor argv keeps the requested model id `cursor-grok-4.6-xhigh`. The
served event is the raw stream object `{ "type": "system", "subtype":
"init", "model": "Cursor Grok 4.6 Extra High", ... }`. A closed map from
that observed label to the requested id is the only accepted served
model. Do not rewrite the event to `type: system/init` or replace the
label with the argv slug to force a PASS. Extra fields such as
`session_id` may be present. Another served label fails.

`injected_bodies` items are `{ "path": "...", "sha256": "..." }` with a
path that is exactly the captured original inside the probe. A zero-read
transcript passes only when that injected body is the original captured
file hash. Returning the canary after reading only the adapter is
`NONCE-WITHOUT-ORIGINAL`. A canary substring, a missing `exit_code`, or a
foreign absolute path with a copied hash is a failed grade.
