# claim: CLAIM-ENFORCE-PROTECTED-METHOD-CROSS-CLASS
# WARN, not FAIL: the refusal is measured for fields only. Enforce
# `protected` reaches only the declaring class and its descendants, and a
# protected FIELD read from an unrelated class stops the module
# (`Variable 'm_DeviceId' is protected`, enforce-script-reference SKILL.md,
# "Moving a body between modules", and ES-PROTECTED-CROSS-MODULE). No
# compile log in this pack shows the same for a METHOD. Pipeline inbox
# fb-20261006-002741-28fa (LFSkateboard) has the shape: `protected void
# LFSK_OnServerState(...)` declared in LFSK_RideCommand, and
# `PlayerBase.OnRPC` (same module, 4_World, unrelated class) calling
# `cmd.LFSK_OnServerState(...)` on a local `LFSK_RideCommand cmd`; the
# ticket does not isolate a compile line for that call.
#
# Judged only when everything is known:
#   - the receiver is a plain name with one plain declared type, as a local
#     still open at the call or a parameter of the same function, or else as
#     a member of the enclosing class itself (the lookup of
#     ES-CAST-UNRELATED-TYPES), so `this` and `super`, never declared, are
#     not judged;
#   - walking up from that type, every class up to the one that declares the
#     method is declared in the addon (not modded and not a template there,
#     its body readable) and nowhere else, modded or not; the first class
#     that declares the method decides, and it declares it `protected` or
#     `private` in every addon declaration that names it;
#   - the calling class is neither that class nor derived from it. A call
#     outside any class counts as unrelated. The caller's parents are read
#     from the non-modded declarations of the addon and the external roots;
#     a class declared in neither (vanilla) cannot derive from an addon
#     class, which is what makes the ticket's `modded class PlayerBase`
#     unrelated. Two parents for one class, or a cycle, skip the call.
# Lines that never compile (shared/dead_branches.py) are not judged.
