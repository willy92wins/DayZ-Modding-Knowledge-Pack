# claim: CLAIM-ENFORCE-PROTO-ARGUMENT-DOWNCAST
# A name passed to a parameter of a `proto` method, when the parameter's
# class derives from the class the name is declared as. Pipeline inbox
# fb-20261006-030019-e074, DayZ 1.30.164014 server:
#
#   DayZPhysics.RaycastRV(from, to, pos, dir, comp, hits, hitEntity,
#       m_Human, true, false, ObjIntersectGeom)
#
# with hitEntity an IEntity (the out argument of CollisionMoveTest) at the
# Object parameter 6 was refused with "Unsafe down-casting, use
# 'Object.Cast'", "Types 'IEntity' and 'Object' are unrelated" and "Cannot
# convert 'IEntity' to 'Object' for argument '6' to method 'RaycastRV'", and
# the World module did not compile. The compiler counts arguments from 0.
# That Object derives from IEntity is read from the vanilla tree when the
# rule runs. Only that pair is measured, so an IEntity where a proto takes
# an Object is FAIL and any other class above the parameter's is WARN. An
# argument of a script method, an argument of an unrelated class and a
# down-cast in an assignment are not judged.
#
# Judged only when everything is known, otherwise skipped without a word:
#   - the call is in a method that shared/method_recognition.py reads (not
#     one whose return type has template arguments, `array<T> F(`);
#   - it is `recv.Method(` with recv a class, or a plain name with one
#     plain declared type, as a local still open at the call, a parameter or
#     a member of the enclosing class (the lookup of ES-CAST-UNRELATED-TYPES),
#     or else as a member of another body of that class or of the nearest
#     class up its chain that declares it. Of another file, a body counts
#     when both files are under N_Module folders (1_Core to 5_Mission) and
#     its module is not later than the call's (a later one is compiled
#     after it); when either is under no such folder, a declaration there
#     leaves the name unknown. A declaration under an #if, #ifdef or #ifndef
#     leaves the name unknown, unless it is in the call's file under blocks
#     that are all around the call;
#   - up the `extends` chain of that class, resolved as in
#     ES-CAST-UNRELATED-TYPES, the first class with a declaration (modded
#     included) whose body names Method before a `(` at its top level
#     declares it `proto` in every one of them, with one parameter list. A
#     declaration whose `(` is on a line that never compiles does not
#     count, and one with a line from its start to its `(` under an #if,
#     #ifdef or #ifndef leaves the method unknown;
#   - the argument is a plain name with one plain declared type, looked up
#     as the receiver is, and the parameter at its index is neither `out`
#     nor `inout` and has a plain class type whose chain resolves;
#   - that chain holds the argument's class above the parameter's own.
#     Class, the implicit root, is not judged as the argument's class.
# A call whose arguments hold `<`, `>` or a directive is skipped, and so is
# one with more arguments than parameters. Proto methods are read from the
# addon, every --external-scripts root and the vanilla tree (comments
# dropped, strings blanked), so without a vanilla tree no vanilla proto is
# judged. Lines that never compile (shared/dead_branches.py) are not judged.
