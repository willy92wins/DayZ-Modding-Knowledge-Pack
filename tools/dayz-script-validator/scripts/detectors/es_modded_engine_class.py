# claim: CLAIM-ENFORCE-MODDED-ENGINE-CLASS
# Some classes are declared by the engine and refuse `modded class`, and the
# whole script module stops compiling. Pipeline inbox fb-20261005-233046-89d1
# (SimpleGroup): `modded class Transport` in scripts/3_Game, DayZDiag
# 1.29.163709:
#
#   Can't compile "Game" script module!
#   .../lfpg_moddedtransport.c(9): Engine class 'Transport' cannot be modded.
#
# Only classes measured in the engine are listed: Transport is the only one.
# Another engine class goes in only after a compile refuses it. To change a
# vehicle, mod the script bases in 4_World instead: CarScript
# (4_world/entities/vehicles/carscript.c:170) or BoatScript (boatscript.c:41).
#
# The refusal holds wherever the line compiles, so code under another mod's
# #ifdef is judged too; what never compiles (shared/dead_branches.py) is not.
