# claim: CLAIM-ENFORCE-CAST-UNRELATED-TYPES
# `X.Cast(y)` where neither X nor the declared type of y derives from the
# other stops the whole script module from compiling. Pipeline inbox
# fb-20261009-122148-c852, DayZDiag 1.29:
#
#   Mission mission = GetGame().GetMission();
#   hud = IngameHud.Cast(mission);
#
# refused the Mission module with `Types 'IngameHud' and 'Mission' are not
# related`. The message is the evidence that neither class derives from the
# other; that IngameHud derives from Hud is the ticket's word, not re-read on
# a vanilla tree for this rule.
#
# Judged only when everything is known, otherwise skipped without a word:
#   - y is a plain name (not a call or a member access) declared in
#     the same function, as a local still open at the cast or a parameter,
#     or else as a member of the enclosing class itself, with one type and
#     no template arguments or array brackets; a later declarator
#     (`int a, y;`) in the function makes y unknown;
#   - X and that type are classes of the addon, the vanilla tree (comments
#     dropped) or an --external-scripts root, not a typedef, an enum, a
#     template or its parameter, nor a primitive;
#   - the whole `extends` chain of both resolves: each class has a
#     declaration that is not `modded` (a modded class does not change the
#     hierarchy) and one parent across all of them (a forward `class X;` is
#     no declaration); a class without a parent ends the chain. Class, the implicit root, is related to everything.
#     A header that a directive splits (`class D` / `#ifdef X` / `: B` /
#     `#endif`) has a parent _CLASS_RE cannot read, so its chain does not
#     resolve.
# Without a vanilla tree a chain that reaches a vanilla class does not
# resolve, so the cast is not judged. Lines that never compile
# (shared/dead_branches.py) are not judged.
