"""Generated copies: one edited source, sealed copies, and the gate that catches drift.

Same idea as the MOVED-EXACT seals, applied to whole files instead of Markdown blocks:
the sha256 is over the RAW BYTES of the source, with no normalization, no BOM and no CRLF
variant. This module owns both halves -- writing a copy and checking one -- so the rule
that decides "in sync" cannot drift between the writer and the checker. `packctl validate`
and `tools/sync_generated.py` both call in here.

Why a sealed copy rather than one file everyone reads: `dayz_3d_viewer` ships as an
installed package. Measured 2026-09-02, it installs NON-editable (a real copy under
site-packages, `direct_url.json` with an empty `dir_info`), so nothing above it resolves to
the pack root and `skills/_shared/` does not exist from there. A package that walked up to
`_shared` would break `python -m dayz_3d_viewer`, a command the README and AGENTS.md
document. So the copy stays, and the gate makes hand-editing it a build failure.

Copies are DISCOVERED by their header, never read from a registry alone: a registry can
forget a file, and a copy that loses its header is reported instead of silently exempted.
