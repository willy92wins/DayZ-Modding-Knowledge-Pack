# `ScriptInputUserData` — the player input channel (build 119356)

`ScriptRPC` is the general script-to-script call; it is not how vanilla moves a
player's own input. For that, build `119356` has a dedicated input channel whose
write end is `ScriptInputUserData`: the caller writes a packet, the engine
carries it with the player's input, and script on the receiving side reads it
back as a `ParamsReadContext`. This note maps that path only — the class, the
guard that gates it, the vanilla write sites, and the engine-driven receive
chain. For `ScriptRPC` itself (target object, `rpc_type`, recipient identity),
see `skills/enforce-script-reference/references/networking.md`; nothing here
replaces it.

All citations are the official scripts, revision `119356`, under `scripts/`.
Paraphrase is the rule: only short signatures are quoted.

## The class

`class ScriptInputUserData : ParamsWriteContext` (`scripts/3_game/gameplay.c:120`)
is a native-backed write context. Its whole declared surface is a constructor
and destructor (`:122-123`), `proto native void Reset()` (`:125`),
`proto native void Send()` (`:126`), `proto native bool CopyFrom(ParamsReadContext other)`
(`:128`), and `proto native static bool CanStoreInputUserData()` (`:131`). Because
it extends `ParamsWriteContext`, payload is written with the inherited `Write(...)`
calls in a fixed order and read back in the same order on the other side; the
class itself adds no field, no addressing, and no delivery option.
[EXACT][CLAIM-INPUT-USERDATA-CLASS]

Two consequences follow directly from those declarations, and both are stated
here as readings of the signatures, not as measured engine behaviour:

- `Send()` takes no argument, so a packet names no destination: there is no
  target object, no recipient identity, and no message id to choose.
- Dispatch inside the packet is the payload's own first value. Vanilla writes
  an `INPUT_UDT_*` constant first (`scripts/3_game/tools/component/_constants.c:2-20`),
  and the receiver reads that first `int` to route the packet (see below).

## The guard: `CanStoreInputUserData()`

The one-line source comment states the contract: the static check returns true
"when the channel is free, AND the InputBuffer is NOT full"
(`scripts/3_game/gameplay.c:130-131`). Vanilla treats a false answer as "do not
start this input action now", not as an error: the predictive inventory entry
points in `scripts/3_game/entities/man.c` abandon the action instead of
writing: the boolean entry points `return false`, and the void entry points use
a bare `return` (`:130`, `:180`, `:241`, `:383`, `:424`, `:474`, `:521`, `:578`,
`:617`, `:660`, `:699`, `:740`); the weapon path returns false at
`scripts/4_world/classes/weapons/weaponmanager.c:792`; and the inventory defers
the pending manipulation event, then runs all four deferred handlers
(`HandleHandEvent`, `HandleTakeToDst`, `HandleSwapEntities`,
`HandleForceSwapEntities`) and clears it only when the guard allows
(`scripts/4_world/systems/inventory/dayzplayerinventory.c:4626-4631`).
[EXACT][CLAIM-INPUT-USERDATA-GUARD]

So the usable pattern is: check, then write, then send — in that order, every
time. Writing first and checking later cannot work: the guard has to pass
before the write. Reading of the declared surface, the only clear is `Reset()`
(`scripts/3_game/gameplay.c:125`), which empties the buffer for reuse; there is
no separate cancel for a packet that was already sent.

## The write/send path in vanilla

The minimal shape appears wherever vanilla sends a one-off input packet: create
the context, `Write(...)` the type constant and then the payload in order, and
call the argument-less `Send()`. The mute notification writes its type, an id
and a flag, then sends (`scripts/3_game/client/onlineservices.c:381-385`); the
weapon manager writes its action type, action and acknowledgement id, adds the
per-action arguments, and sends at the end of the same method
(`scripts/4_world/classes/weapons/weaponmanager.c:525-571`); the bot spam test
builds hand-event and move packets the same way and sends each one
(`scripts/4_world/systems/bot/bot_testspamuseractions.c:73-102`).

Inventory is the heavy user, and it shows the second shape: a packet built to be
handed on, not sent in place. Hand events are serialised into a fresh context at
`scripts/4_world/systems/inventory/dayzplayerinventory.c:1603-1604`,
`:1665-1666`, `:1701-1702`, `:1759-1760` and `:1890-1891`, and the resulting
context is then consumed by the juncture/validation flow of the same file; other
sites build one to pass to `SendSyncJuncture(...)` (`:3786`, `:4257`) or to build
a writable serializer via the constructor form at `:3381`, `:3469` and `:4465`.
`CopyFrom(ParamsReadContext)` is what lets a read-side serializer be turned into
one of these writable packets (`:3381-3383`, `:3469-3471`).
[EXACT][CLAIM-INPUT-USERDATA-SEND]

The first written value is the routing key: the inventory serializers write
`INPUT_UDT_INVENTORY` before the command body
(`scripts/3_game/systems/inventory/inventoryinputuserdata.c:7`,
`:72`, `:107`), exactly as the mute and weapon sites write their own constants
first. A custom packet that omits that first `int`, or writes it in a different
position, will not match the receiver's read.

## The receive path is engine-driven

No script registers for these packets; the engine delivers them. The documented
origin, in the inventory's own header comment, is "engine -
`DayZPlayer::OnInputUserDataReceived`" feeding "script -
`DayZPlayerImplement.OnInputUserDataReceived`"
(`scripts/4_world/systems/inventory/dayzplayerinventory.c:699-704`). That script
entry point reads the first `int` as the user-data type and passes the rest of
the context on (`scripts/4_world/entities/dayzplayerimplement.c:3040-3049`).

From there the inventory branch is three steps. `DayZPlayerInventory.OnInputUserDataProcess(ParamsReadContext)`
stores the packet through the native `StoreInputUserData(ctx)` instead of
handling it inline (`scripts/4_world/systems/inventory/dayzplayerinventory.c:705-716`,
`:758`). The later handling step, `OnHandleStoredInputUserData`, reads its
leading value and, in the non-diagnostic path, runs the server inventory
validation when `g_Game.IsServer()` holds — and calls
`Error("OnHandleStoredInputUserData - Client")` otherwise (`:722-749`, the
`Error` itself at `:748`). Packets addressed to a remote (non-owning) player
take the sibling entry `OnInputUserDataForRemote(ParamsReadContext)`, which
reaches the remote execution path (`:761-782`); the player routes the
`INPUT_UDT_INVENTORY` case to it at
`scripts/4_world/entities/dayzplayerimplement.c:963-965`.
[EXACT][CLAIM-INPUT-USERDATA-RECEIVE]

Because delivery is engine-driven, there is no script-side subscription to
forget. The engine calls `DayZPlayerImplement.OnInputUserDataReceived`
(`scripts/4_world/entities/dayzplayerimplement.c:3040-3049`), which routes the
packet; a mod can override that entry point, but it cannot replace the delivery.
A mod that needs custom input behaviour hooks the handling/validation side, or
sends its own packet and handles it in its own player code.

## The two sibling contexts

Two related classes sit directly below in the same file. `class ScriptRemoteInputUserData : ParamsWriteContext`
adds a constructor, a destructor and `proto native void Reset()` — and nothing
else: no `Send()`, no `CopyFrom`, no guard
(`scripts/3_game/gameplay.c:143-149`). `class ScriptJunctureData : ParamsWriteContext`
has the same minimal shape (`scripts/3_game/gameplay.c:151-157`). The
declarations alone do not say where they are used, but the 119356 call sites
do: `ScriptRemoteInputUserData` is created, written and handed to
`StoreInputForRemotes` in `SyncHandEventToRemote`
(`scripts/4_world/systems/inventory/dayzplayerinventory.c:4375-4388`), and
`ScriptJunctureData` is created and written in
`scripts/4_world/entities/dayzplayersyncjunctures.c` (for example `:46`, `:67`,
`:91`, `:101`, `:146`). This note maps the class surface and those examples; it
does not assign the full delivery lifecycle of either path.

## `ScriptInputUserData` or `ScriptRPC`?

This distinction is an inference from the declarations and call sites above,
labelled as such; it is not a statement the source makes in one place.

| Question | `ScriptInputUserData` | `ScriptRPC` |
|---|---|---|
| Destination chosen by caller | No — `Send()` has no argument | Yes — target, id and recipient are send arguments |
| Routing key | First payload `int` (`INPUT_UDT_*`) | The `rpc_type` argument |
| Receiver | The player input path (engine-delivered) | The target's `OnRPC` handler |
| Typical vanilla payload | Own-player input: actions, inventory, weapons | General script messages either direction |

Use the input channel when the message *is* player input — something the
owning client originates and the server must validate as input. Use
`ScriptRPC` for everything addressed: a specific object, a specific player, or
a reply. The full `ScriptRPC` contract, including the server-to-client target
rule, stays in `skills/enforce-script-reference/references/networking.md`.

## Gotchas

- Check `CanStoreInputUserData()` before writing, not before sending: vanilla
  checks at the decision point and abandons or defers the action on false.
- `Send()` takes no arguments. Any design that needs a target, a recipient or a
  message id is a `ScriptRPC` design, not this one.
- The receive path is engine-driven; do not wait for a registration call or an
  invoker that the scripts do not contain.
- `OnHandleStoredInputUserData` errors on a client (`.../dayzplayerinventory.c:748`):
  handling stored input is server work in this build's inventory path.
- Server-side validation remains the handler's responsibility. The channel
  delivers a client's packet; nothing in the class declarations validates its
  contents, and the vanilla inventory routes stored packets into its server
  validation for exactly that reason (`:742-745`).

## How to reproduce

From the root of the extracted build-`119356` script tree:

```text
grep -n "class ScriptInputUserData" scripts/3_game/gameplay.c
grep -n "CanStoreInputUserData" scripts/3_game/entities/man.c scripts/4_world/classes/weapons/weaponmanager.c
grep -n "OnInputUserDataProcess\|StoreInputUserData\|OnHandleStoredInputUserData\|OnInputUserDataForRemote" scripts/4_world/systems/inventory/dayzplayerinventory.c
grep -n "ScriptInputUserData" scripts/3_game/client/onlineservices.c scripts/4_world/systems/bot/bot_testspamuseractions.c
grep -n "ScriptRemoteInputUserData\|ScriptJunctureData" scripts/3_game/gameplay.c scripts/4_world/systems/inventory/dayzplayerinventory.c scripts/4_world/entities/dayzplayersyncjunctures.c
```

## Limits

- Build `119356` only; line numbers and the guard placement are this build's.
- Source reading, not an in-game test: no statement here claims measured runtime
  behaviour, delivery timing, or buffer sizes beyond the one-line source comment.
- The engine side (`DayZPlayer::OnInputUserDataReceived`, the native bodies of
  `Send`, `Reset`, `CopyFrom` and `StoreInputUserData`) is not in the script
  tree; its existence is documented by the script declarations and comments.
- No vanilla code is copied into the Pack beyond the short signatures quoted
  above; everything else is paraphrase with a `path:line` citation.
