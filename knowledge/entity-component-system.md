# Entity component system (`GenericEntity` / `GenericComponent` / `ScriptComponent`)

## Scope and build

This note maps the **declared** Enfusion entity component surface in the
official DayZ scripts, build `119356`. [EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-GUARD]
It is a source map, not a tutorial: every statement below paraphrases the
cited declaration or its own comment, with a `path:line` locator; no engine
behaviour beyond those comments is claimed, and nothing was measured at
runtime. `ScriptedEntity`, triggers, ScriptRPC/networking and persistence
streams are out of scope here.

Primary sources, all under `scripts/` in the build `119356` tree:
`2_gamelib/components/gamelibcomponents.c` (component classes),
`2_gamelib/entities/gamelibentities.c` (entity classes),
`1_core/proto/enentity.c` (the `IEntity` constructor declaration) and
`staticdefinesdoc.c` (the static-define documentation table).

## The `COMPONENT_SYSTEM` guard

The whole of `gamelibcomponents.c` sits between `#ifdef COMPONENT_SYSTEM`
at line 1 and `#endif` at line 276, so the component classes in that file
are compiled only when the flag is defined. [EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-GUARD]
`GenericEntity` is likewise declared under `#ifdef COMPONENT_SYSTEM` at
`gamelibentities.c:3` (matching `#endif` at line 141), and the `IEntity`
constructor `protected void IEntity(IEntitySource src, IEntity parent)` is
declared under the same guard at `enentity.c:768-771`.
[EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-GUARD]
The documentation table describes `COMPONENT_SYSTEM` as the "Enfusion
entity component system" and records it as not defined for DayZ builds
and defined for Workbench builds (`staticdefinesdoc.c:15`).
[EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-GUARD]
Read that narrowly: this note claims compilation conditional on the flag,
and what the documentation table records — not that a given shipped DayZ
build enables or disables the system at runtime.

## Class map

`GenericComponent : Managed` is the base component class, and its
constructor is `protected void GenericComponent(IEntityComponentSource
src, IEntity ent)` (`gamelibcomponents.c:25-68`).
[EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-GENERIC]
`IEntityComponentSource` is declared just above it as a `BaseContainer`
with a `typedef int[]` of the same name (`gamelibcomponents.c:4-7`).
[EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-GUARD]
`ScriptComponent : GenericComponent` is the parent class for components
created in script, and every `ScriptComponent` is created in the entity
constructor (`gamelibcomponents.c:75-86`). [EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-SCRIPT]
`GenericEntity extends IEntity` is the entity side of the pair
(`gamelibentities.c:4`); the same guarded block declares
`GenericWorldEntity`, `GenericTerrainEntity` and `LightEntity` as its
subclasses (`gamelibentities.c:49-57`). A `GenericComponentClass` with a
`DependsOn(typename, TypeID)` stub sits at `gamelibcomponents.c:70-73`;
the cited range shows no further contract for it.

## Insert, remove, delete

`FindComponent(typename typeName)` returns the first occurrence of the
corresponding component (`gamelibentities.c:9-13`).
[EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-FIND]
`InsertComponent(GenericComponent)` calls `OnComponentInsert` on all of
the entity's components, calls `EOnInit` on the component if it sets the
`EV_INIT` mask, and calls `EOnActivate` if the component is active, which
is the default (`gamelibentities.c:15-22`). [EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-INSERT]
`RemoveComponent(GenericComponent)` removes the component without
deleting the entity, calls `EOnDeactivate` on the component, and calls
`OnComponentRemove` on all of the entity's components
(`gamelibentities.c:24-30`). [EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-REMOVE]
`DeleteComponent(GenericComponent)` does everything `RemoveComponent`
does and additionally calls `OnDelete` on the component
(`gamelibentities.c:32-39`). [EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-REMOVE]

## Lifecycle and event order

The `ScriptComponent` class comment declares this order
(`gamelibcomponents.c:77-84`): [EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-SCRIPT]

1. `OnComponentInsert` on creation (last Workbench event in edit mode).
2. `EOnInit` after all components are inserted, only with `EV_INIT` set.
3. `EOnActivate` if the entity is `TFL_ACTIVE` and the component is
   active; a component is active by default.
4. The remaining `EOn*` events, per the registered event mask.
5. `EOnDeactivate` on `Deactivate` or removal; must be active to
   deactivate.
6. `OnComponentRemove` after a component is removed.
7. Deletion notification as the entity is going to be destroyed.

Steps 2, 3, 5 and 6 restate the insert/remove contract above.
[EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-EVENTS]
One naming wrinkle in the source: step 7 of the comment says `EOnDelete`,
while the declared method is `OnDelete(IEntity owner)`, whose own comment
says it is called when the entity is being destroyed or the component is
to be deleted via `Game::DeleteScriptComponent`
(`gamelibcomponents.c:228-232`). [EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-EVENTS]

## Event masks

`GenericComponent` exposes `GetEventMask()`, `SetEventMask(IEntity owner,
int mask)`, `ClearEventMask(IEntity owner, int mask)`, `Activate(IEntity
owner)`, `Deactivate(IEntity owner)` and `IsActive()`
(`gamelibcomponents.c:31-64`). [EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-GENERIC]
`SetEventMask` ORs the given bits into the existing mask, and a component
accepts only events whose bits are set in its mask
(`gamelibcomponents.c:33-40`). [EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-GENERIC]
The constructor caveat is declared in that same comment: calling
`SetEventMask` in the component constructor does not properly set the
event mask on the parent entity, and the comment recommends
`OnComponentInsert` instead (`gamelibcomponents.c:36`).
[EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-GENERIC]
`ClearEventMask` clears only the bits set in its argument
(`gamelibcomponents.c:42-48`). [EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-GENERIC]

## Declared `ScriptComponent` signatures

All of the following are `protected void` declarations on
`ScriptComponent` (`gamelibcomponents.c:95-232`).
[EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-EVENTS]

Lifecycle and component membership: `EOnInit(IEntity owner, int extra)`
(after all of the entity's components have received `OnComponentInsert`),
`EOnActivate(IEntity owner)`, `EOnDeactivate(IEntity owner)`,
`OnComponentInsert(IEntity owner, ScriptComponent other)`,
`OnComponentRemove(IEntity owner, ScriptComponent other)` and
`OnDelete(IEntity owner)`.

Frame, visibility and simulation: `EOnFrame(IEntity owner, float
timeSlice)`, `EOnPostFrame(IEntity owner, int extra)`,
`EOnVisible(IEntity owner, int extra)`,
`EOnNotVisible(IEntity owner, int extra)`,
`EOnSimulate(IEntity owner, float timeslice)` and
`EOnPostSimulate(IEntity owner, float timeslice)`.

Touch, physics and miscellaneous: `EOnTouch(IEntity owner, int extra)`,
`EOnContact(IEntity owner, Contact extra)`,
`EOnPhysicsMove(IEntity owner, int extra)`,
`EOnJointBreak(IEntity owner, int extra)`,
`EOnAnimEvent(IEntity owner, AnimEvent extra)`,
`EOnSoundEvent(IEntity owner, SoundEvent extra)` and
`EOnExtra(IEntity owner, int extra)` — an extension event; the comment
notes a Trigger uses it when an insider is leaving.

The `TouchEvent` enum declares `ON_ENTER`, `ON_STAY` and `ON_EXIT`
(`gamelibcomponents.c:9-15`). [EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-TOUCH]

## `BaseSoundComponent`: a vanilla example

`BaseSoundComponent : GenericComponent` is a vanilla script-side
component for sound, declared at `gamelibcomponents.c:248-274`.
[EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-BASESOUND]
Its declared native surface lists event and signal names
(`GetEventNames`, `GetSignalNames`, `GetSignalIndex`), sets signal values
by name or index (`SetSignalValueName`, `SetSignalValue`), plays and
updates sounds returning a `SoundHandle` (`Play`, `Update`), terminates
a sound (`Terminate`, `void`), queries it (`IsPlayed`, `IsHandleValid`,
`bool`), and declares `SetTransform(vector[])` and `SetDebug(bool)`
(`gamelibcomponents.c:248-274`). [EXACT][CLAIM-COMPONENT-BASESOUND]

## What is not claimed

- No runtime behaviour: nothing was spawned, inserted or removed in a
  running build.
- No enablement claim beyond the guard and the table cited above.
- No config-registration tutorial: the cited ranges do not show how a mod
  registers a component type in config, so this note does not describe one.
- No definition of `EV_INIT`, `TFL_ACTIVE` or `enf::EntityEvents`: the
  comments reference them; their declarations are outside the cited ranges.

## Reproduce

From the build `119356` script tree (paths relative to `scripts/`):

```sh
sed -n '1,276p' 2_gamelib/components/gamelibcomponents.c
sed -n '1,141p'  2_gamelib/entities/gamelibentities.c
sed -n '768,771p' 1_core/proto/enentity.c
sed -n '15p' staticdefinesdoc.c
sha256sum 2_gamelib/components/gamelibcomponents.c \
  2_gamelib/entities/gamelibentities.c \
  1_core/proto/enentity.c staticdefinesdoc.c
```

Expected SHA-256 — `gamelibcomponents.c`:
`5ffaed4be8ceab6aea526118e9be61247dfb72a652ba3a71c12889af136deae9`;
`gamelibentities.c`:
`defbc4011bc1d3ed310f22fad7bf1c90015a0c4d29764c8245b8805f47b835ab`;
`enentity.c`:
`8c54e810605c758c852713cca6ea4cc4e3a81311f22601bce101231e05ea246a`;
`staticdefinesdoc.c`:
`59e509055a4c06306871b7f41a2904e567c4ce2186878742e0ce2158b49437ac`.

## Limits and open questions

- The mask values (`EV_INIT`, the rest of `enf::EntityEvents`) and
  `TFL_ACTIVE` are referenced, not defined, in the cited ranges.
- Whether any shipped DayZ build defines `COMPONENT_SYSTEM` for game code
  is not settled here; the table records Workbench only.
- `GenericComponentClass.DependsOn` is an empty stub in the cited range;
  whether the engine consumes it is not claimed.
- Cross-component event order on one entity is not described in the cited
  comments and is not claimed.
