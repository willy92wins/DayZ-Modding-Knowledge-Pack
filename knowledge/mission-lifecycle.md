# Mission lifecycle — bootstrap order and the exact `super` chain (build 119356)

Most mission bugs that look like engine caprice are order bugs: code that runs before
the object it touches exists, a `super` call placed where vanilla does not place it, or
a second `OnInit` pass a modder did not know could happen. This note is the script-side
map for build `119356`: which mission entry points exist, what each one calls first and
last, and which guards decide whether the body runs at all. It covers only what the
scripts show; the native calls that create the mission and invoke these entry points are
not in the script tree (see Limits).

The class spine, root first, is `Mission` → `MissionBaseWorld` → `MissionBase` →
`MissionServer` / `MissionGameplay` (`scripts/3_game/gameplay.c:685`;
`scripts/4_world/classes/missionbaseworld.c:1`;
`scripts/5_mission/mission/missionbase.c:1`;
`scripts/5_mission/mission/missionserver.c:5`;
`scripts/5_mission/mission/missiongameplay.c:1`).

## The order

Script-visible order, per side. The constructor is the first script code of the mission
object; `OnInit`, `OnMissionStart` and `OnUpdate` follow as separate engine-invoked
entry points.

| Step | Server | Client |
|---|---|---|
| Construct | `MissionServer()` after `MissionBase()` | `MissionGameplay()` after `MissionBase()` |
| Initialise | `MissionServer.OnInit()` | `MissionGameplay.OnInit()` |
| Start | `MissionServer.OnMissionStart()` | `MissionGameplay.OnMissionStart()` |
| Tick | `MissionServer.OnUpdate(timeslice)` | `MissionGameplay.OnUpdate(timeslice)` |

Two asymmetries in that table do real damage when assumed away: the server `OnUpdate`
calls `super` **last**, the base `OnUpdate` calls it **first**; and
`MissionGameplay.OnMissionStart` does not call `super` at all, while
`MissionServer.OnMissionStart` does. Both are spelled out below.

## MissionBase and MissionServer

The `MissionBase` constructor (`scripts/5_mission/mission/missionbase.c:17`) calls
`InitialiseWorldData()` at `:30`, and `InitialiseWorldData` (`:107`) assigns
`m_WorldData = new ChernarusPlusData()` for `chernarusplus` at `:116` and again as the
default branch at `:148`; the constructor therefore runs before any `OnInit`, and a
custom mission must not assume world data is absent at `OnInit`.
[EXACT][CLAIM-MISSION-BASE-CONSTRUCTOR]

`MissionServer.OnInit` (`scripts/5_mission/mission/missionserver.c:85`) calls
`super.OnInit()` at `:87` and then the server data loads:
`CfgGameplayHandler.LoadData()` (`:88`), `PlayerSpawnHandler.LoadData()` (`:89`),
`CfgPlayerRestrictedAreaHandler.LoadData()` (`:90`),
`UndergroundAreaLoader.SpawnAllTriggerCarriers()` (`:91`) and
`CfgBunkerBroadcastHandler.LoadData()` (`:95`); the chain bottoms out in
`Mission.OnInit`, which is empty (`scripts/3_game/gameplay.c:700`), and the rain handler
is not created here but in the `MissionServer` constructor
(`scripts/5_mission/mission/missionserver.c:66`), which assigns `m_RainProcHandler = new
RainProcurementHandler(this)` at `:76`. [EXACT][CLAIM-MISSION-SERVER-ONINIT]

`MissionServer.OnUpdate` (`scripts/5_mission/mission/missionserver.c:108`) runs its own
systems first — dummy scheduler, tick scheduler, logout players, base-environment
temperature — calls `m_RainProcHandler.Update(timeslice)` at `:124`, and only then calls
`super.OnUpdate(timeslice)` at `:129`; below it, `MissionBase.OnUpdate`
(`scripts/5_mission/mission/missionbase.c:85`) calls `super.OnUpdate(timeslice)` first,
at `:87`, and `Mission.OnUpdate` (`scripts/3_game/gameplay.c:703-708`) only advances the
cursor timestamp under `FEATURE_CURSOR`; the rain handler is a `MissionServer` member
(`scripts/5_mission/mission/missionserver.c:11`), returned by its
`GetRainProcurementHandler` override at `:835-837`, while
`MissionBaseWorld.GetRainProcurementHandler`
(`scripts/4_world/classes/missionbaseworld.c:3-6`) returns `null`, so a custom
`MissionBase` that is not a `MissionServer` has no rain handler.
[EXACT][CLAIM-MISSION-SERVER-UPDATE]

## MissionGameplay

`MissionGameplay.OnInit` (`scripts/5_mission/mission/missiongameplay.c:102`) calls
`super.OnInit()` at `:104`, then returns at once if `m_Initialized` is set (`:106-109`)
— the flag its constructor clears at `:67` — then, under `DIAG_DEVELOPER` on a
non-multiplayer session only, loads gameplay, underground and bunker-broadcast data
(`:115-117`), calls `PPEffects.Init()` at `:122` (marked deprecated in the source),
`MapMarkerTypes.Init()` at `:123`, takes the UI manager at `:125`, sets `m_Initialized =
true` at `:127`, and creates the HUD from `gui/layouts/day_z_hud.layout` at `:132`.
[EXACT][CLAIM-MISSION-GAMEPLAY-ONINIT]

That guard is the whole override recipe for the client:

- A second `OnInit` on the same mission object returns after the `super` call and
  re-creates nothing. That is the designed re-entry path.
- A modded override that sets `m_Initialized = true` **before** calling `super.OnInit()`
  makes the vanilla body skip itself: no HUD layout, no chat or action-menu wiring from
  this method. That is a deliberate replacement of the base UI, not a shortcut — do it
  only if the mod creates everything `:130-167` creates.
- Leaving the flag alone and calling `super.OnInit()` first is the normal case: the base
  UI exists before any mod line runs.

`MissionGameplay.OnMissionStart` (`scripts/5_mission/mission/missiongameplay.c:193`)
does **not** call `super.OnMissionStart()`: its body starts with
`g_Game.SetConnecting(false)` at `:195`, hides the UI cursor at `:199`, sets the mission
state to game at `:202`, and its `EffectAreaLoader` zone/bunker block at `:209-211` sits
inside the `DIAG_DEVELOPER` / `!IsMultiplayer` guard at `:204-214`; by contrast,
`MissionServer.OnMissionStart` (`scripts/5_mission/mission/missionserver.c:99`) calls
`super.OnMissionStart()` at `:101` and then `EffectAreaLoader.CreateZones()` at `:104`
unconditionally, and `Mission.OnMissionStart` (`scripts/3_game/gameplay.c:701`) is
empty. [EXACT][CLAIM-MISSION-GAMEPLAY-ONMISSIONSTART]

Two traps follow. Adding `super.OnMissionStart()` to a modded `MissionGameplay` override
does not call an empty base: it runs the vanilla `MissionGameplay.OnMissionStart` body
above (`SetConnecting`, cursor, mission state, and the developer-only zone block), so
omitting it skips the client bootstrap and cuts the chain of other mods. The vanilla
`MissionGameplay.OnMissionStart` itself does not call `super`, so the empty
`Mission.OnMissionStart` is not reached on the client; the server override, by contrast,
calls `super` and then `CreateZones()`. And the client zone creation a modder sees in a
developer single-player session is not the multiplayer path: on a real client those zones
arrive from the server, whose `CreateZones()` is not guarded.

## RPC routing

`DayZGame.OnRPC` (`scripts/3_game/dayzgame.c:3141`) calls `super.OnRPC(sender, target,
rpc_type, ctx)` at `:3143`, fires its RPC event invoker at `:3144`, and, when a target
object exists, calls `target.OnRPC(sender, rpc_type, ctx)` at `:3151`; with no target it
switches on the RPC type, and the gameplay-config case calls
`CfgGameplayHandler.OnRPC(null, ctx)` at `:3161`, a separate static handler declared at
`scripts/3_game/cfggameplayhandler.c:102`. [EXACT][CLAIM-MISSION-RPC-ROUTING]

So there are three distinct places an RPC can land, and they are not interchangeable:
the game object itself, the target object's own `OnRPC`, and — only for the named
config-sync types and only with no target — a static config handler. A custom `OnRPC`
override that does not call `super.OnRPC` for IDs it does not recognise cuts the chain
below it; handle the IDs the mod owns, then pass the rest through.

## Persistence hooks

`skills/dayz-persistence/` already owns the stream contract (field order, version,
failed-read behaviour); this section only fixes what exists in this build. Counting
every occurrence in the `.c` files under `scripts/` gives 135 `OnStoreSave` and 148
`OnStoreLoad`; `RegisterPersistent` does not occur, and the only `RegisterPersistent*`
symbol is `RegisterPersistentObject` in `scripts/4_world/entities/building/underground/powergeneratorstatic.c:18,26`;
the per-entity pair is `EntityAI.OnStoreSave` at `scripts/3_game/entities/entityai.c:2910` and `EntityAI.OnStoreLoad` at `:2978`.
[EXACT][CLAIM-MISSION-PERSISTENCE-HOOKS]

A mod that goes looking for a registration call is looking for something the build does
not have: persistence is the override pair above, called by the engine per entity, and
nothing registers an entity for it in script.

## What this changes

For a modded mission in this build, in order:

1. Construction already happened — world data included — before any `OnInit` line runs.
   Put nothing in `OnInit` whose job is to "beat" the world-data creation.
2. Server `OnInit`: call `super.OnInit()` first, then add work; the vanilla loads follow
   the call in the same body, so mod code in an override runs after them only if it also
   runs after its own `super` call returns.
3. Client `OnInit`: call `super.OnInit()` first for the base UI, or set `m_Initialized`
   before it to replace that UI wholesale — never set the flag by accident in a
   constructor or a helper the constructor calls, because the skip is silent.
4. `OnMissionStart`: the server override keeps `super` first; the gameplay override must
   also call `super` to run the vanilla client body above, even though that vanilla body
   does not itself call `super` and the empty `Mission.OnMissionStart` is not reached.
5. `OnUpdate`: pick the side of `super` deliberately per level — the server body
   finishes with it, the base body starts with it.
6. `OnRPC`: own specific IDs, pass everything else to `super`.

## How to reproduce

From the root of the extracted build-119356 script tree:

```text
grep -n "InitialiseWorldData\|void MissionBase()" scripts/5_mission/mission/missionbase.c
grep -n "super.OnInit\|super.OnMissionStart\|super.OnUpdate\|m_RainProcHandler" scripts/5_mission/mission/missionserver.c
grep -n "m_Initialized\|PPEffects.Init\|MapMarkerTypes.Init\|day_z_hud" scripts/5_mission/mission/missiongameplay.c
grep -n "target.OnRPC\|CfgGameplayHandler.OnRPC" scripts/3_game/dayzgame.c
grep -R -E '\bOnStoreSave\b' --include='*.c' scripts | wc -l    # 135
grep -R -E '\bOnStoreLoad\b' --include='*.c' scripts | wc -l    # 148
grep -R -E '\bRegisterPersistent\b' --include='*.c' scripts | wc -l    # 0
grep -R -n -E '\bRegisterPersistentObject\b' --include='*.c' scripts   # 2 hits
```

The last four commands reproduce the figures in the persistence section: 135 and 148
occurrences, zero exact `RegisterPersistent`, and the two `RegisterPersistentObject` hits.

## Limits

- Build `119356` only. Line numbers, the guard placement and the empty base bodies are
  this build's; re-verify before citing them on another.
- The script-visible order above is exact; the native dispatch that creates the mission
  object and invokes `OnInit`, `OnMissionStart` and `OnUpdate` is not in the scripts, so
  nothing here says when the engine calls them relative to world or player creation.
- No runtime verification: this is source reading, not an in-game test, and no statement
  here claims measured in-game behaviour.
- No vanilla code is copied into the Pack; the note paraphrases and cites `scripts/...` locations only.
